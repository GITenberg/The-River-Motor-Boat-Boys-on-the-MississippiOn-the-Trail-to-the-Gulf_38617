<h2 class='chapter' id='clink01'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER I—A RAMBLER RECEPTION DAY</a></h2>

<p>A white bulldog of ferocious aspect lay sound
asleep under a small table. Lying across the dog’s
neck, with his soft muzzle hidden between capable
paws, was a quarter-grown grizzly bear. Now and
then Captain Joe, as the dog was named, stirred uneasily
in his sleep, as if in remonstrance at the liberties
which Teddy, the cub, was taking with his
person. The bulldog and the cub snored in unison!</p>

<p>The table under which the animals slept stood in
the middle of the small cabin of the motor boat
<i>Rambler</i>, and the <i>Rambler</i> was pulling at her anchor
chain in the muddy water of the Mississippi river—pulling
and jerking for all the world like a fat pig
with a ring in his nose trying to get rid of the line
which held him in captivity.</p>

<p>Although early in November, there were
wandering flakes of snow in the air, and a chill wind from
the northwest was sweeping over the Mississippi
valley. There had been several days of continuous
rain, and, at Cairo, where the motor boat lay, both
the Mississippi and the Ohio rivers were out of their
banks.</p>

<p>In spite of the wind and snow, however, the
cabin of the <i>Rambler</i> was cozy and warm. In front
of the table where the bulldog and the young bear
lay stood a coal stove, on the top of which two boys
of sixteen, Clayton Emmett and Alexander Smithwick,
were cooking ham and eggs, the appetizing
flavor of which filled the little room. A dish of
sliced potatoes stood not far away, and over the
cherry-red coils of an electric stove at the rear of
the cabin a great pot of coffee was sizzling and adding
its fragrance to rich contributions of the frying
pan.</p>

<p>While the boys, growing hungrier every second,
stirred the fire and laid the table, footsteps were
heard on the forward deck of the motor boat, and
then, without even announcing his presence by a
knock, a roughly-dressed man of perhaps forty years
stepped into the cabin and stood for a moment staring
at the bulldog and the bear, stood with a hand
on the knob of the door, as if ready for retreat, his
lips open, as if the view of the interior had checked
words half spoken. Alex. Smithwick regarded the
man for a moment with a flash of anger in his eyes,
then he caught the humor of the situation and resolved
to punish the intruder for his impudence in
walking into the cabin without a bit of ceremony.</p>

<p>“Look out for the bulldog and the bear!” he
warned. “They consumed two river-men last week!
The bulldog tears ’em down, an’ the bear eats ’em!”</p>

<p>“What kind of a menagerie is this?” began the
visitor, but Alex. gave the bulldog a touch with his
foot, and the dog and the bear were in the middle of
the space between the table and the stove, snarling
fiercely, before the startled intruder could open the
door. “Call the brutes off!” he added as Teddy
began boxing the empty air.</p>

<p>“Don’t stand in the doorway!” Alex. warned,
while Clay Emmett turned his face away so as not
to betray his enjoyment of the situation. “It makes
’em mad to keep the door open! What do you
want?”</p>

<p>The visitor stepped outside and beckoned to the
boys through the glass panel. Alex. went out on
the deck and stood waiting. The visitor was evidently
a riverman, tall, muscular, heavy of hand
and sullen of face. He wore rough clothing, neither
clean nor whole, and his face was well covered by a
bushy beard, light in color except around the
mouth, where it was stained with tobacco. Alex.
noted that he looked away whenever their eyes met
for an instant.</p>

<p>“I’m Gid Brent, the riverman,” he said, in a
moment, “and I’ve come to warn you boys against
starting out alone, on the river in this boat.”</p>

<p>“That’s kind of you,” Alex. replied. “What’s
the matter with the boat?”</p>

<p>“It is the river there’s something the matter
with,” replied the other. “The water is high, and is
pouring into all the old channels and ditches from
Cairo to the Gulf. If you start out without a pilot,
you’ll run into some bayou and end in a swamp, a
couple of hundred miles from the main channel.”</p>

<p>“You’re a pilot, eh?” asked Alex., with a provoking
grin.</p>

<p>“Yes; and I’m called the best on the river,” was
the boasting reply.</p>

<p>“And you’re looking for a job?” Alex. continued,
insinuatingly.</p>

<p>“I might accept the right kind of a job,” Brent
replied, “but I shouldn’t want any menagerie on
board with me. Where are you boys going?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” Alex. said, gravely, though there was
fun in his eyes, “if you object to our pets, that settles
it! We brought Captain Joe, the bulldog, from
the Amazon, and Teddy Bear, the cub, from British
Columbia.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if they’re tame!” the other exclaimed. “I
might——”</p>

<p>“I’ll call ’em out an’ see what they say to you!”
Alex. replied, mischief in his eyes, opening the cabin
door and inviting the bulldog and the bear out to the
deck!</p>

<p>Captain Joe snarled at the man’s feet and Teddy
Bear stood up and squared off in front of him in a
boxing attitude! Brent swung toward the little pier
against which the motor boat lay, and the animals,
thus encouraged, sprang at him.</p>

<p>In a minute the pilot was on the pier, racing
toward the shore as if for his life! Clay came out
on deck and both boys stood laughing at the retreating
figure. Presently Brent came to an old warehouse,
where security might be found in an open
doorway. Here he stopped and turned back, shaking
a fist at the grinning lads.</p>

<p>“I’ll be even with you for that!” he shouted.
“I’ll teach you to set your dog on me, you miserable
little bum-boat tramps! I’ll show you!”</p>

<p>“Get him, Captain Joe!” cried Alex., angry at
the impertinent language used, but Clay caught the
bulldog by the collar and held him back.</p>

<p>“All right!” smiled Alex. “Let the tramp go,
if you want to! Anyway, I’m about half starved!
Funny, Case and Jule don’t get back! They’ve been
gone three hours!”</p>

<p>“They’ll get cold beans for supper if they don’t
show up pretty soon!” Clay said, turning back to
the cabin. “The ham and eggs and potatoes are
just done!”</p>

<p>Even as Alex. closed the cabin door behind
himself, running footsteps were heard, and the next moment
two boys of about his own age, Cornelius
Witters and Julian Shafer, made their appearance,
racing off the pier and on to the deck of the motor
boat like young colts. They dashed into the cabin
and dropped down into seats at the table.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with the fellow at the head
of the pier?” Case Witters asked. “He called to us
not to come down here! Said there was a crazy
boy, a mad dog and a grizzly loose in the boat!
Guess you got him peeved, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“He’s too fresh!” Alex. responded. “He came
on board as if he owned the boat, and then had
the nerve to tell us that we’d get lost if we went
down the river without a pilot! He wanted a pilot’s
job! We should have given Captain Joe a bite out
of him!”</p>

<p>“Did he say he was a pilot?” asked Jule Shafer,
with a wink at Case.</p>

<p>“Sure thing he did!” answered Alex. “Said he
was the best on the river!”</p>

<p>“Well,” Case began, “if he is a pilot he is out of
practice! I heard him asking a man about the passage
from Hickman to Reelfoot lake. When we
went up-town that same man who spoke to us on
the pier stood on the levee with a bunch of toughs.
Their heads were together, as if they were planning
mischief. I thought they looked at Jule and I in a
strange way, too!”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he ever came on board to get a
job!” Jule broke in. “He’s a spy! That’s just
what he is, and I wish Captain Joe had eaten him
up!”</p>

<p>“But why should he come spying here?” asked
Clay. “We’re not river thieves!”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s something odd going on at Cairo!”
Case asserted. “There are crowds on the streets,
and the policemen seem to be on their metal! I
guess we would have been locked up as suspects if
we hadn’t had on pretty good clothes!”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you ask some one to tell you about
it?” demanded Alex.</p>

<p>“We did,” Jule answered, “and got our trouble
for our pains! There’s been a warehouse robbery
up the river somewhere, but I don’t see why that
should make such a stir down here at Cairo. The
merchant I ordered the gasoline of said that $100,000
in diamonds and furs had been taken, and
that a watchman who resisted had been seriously
wounded.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they think we’re the thieves!” suggested
Clay.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if they did,” Case grinned.
“Anyway, the men I talked with seemed to have
loose shingles—they acted that way, all right!”</p>

<p>“Loose shingles!” cried Alex. “You’ll wash
dishes for a week for that! Loose shingles is
slang, and we’re not to talk slang. If you wanted
to indicate a slant in the belfry, why didn’t you
say——”</p>

<p>“Slant in the belfry!” roared Case. “Guess
that isn’t slang! I’ll have plenty of help washing
dishes, all right. S-a-a-y, listen to that, will you!”</p>

<p>As the boy spoke he lifted a hand for silence, and
the four sat at the table silent and motionless. It
was growing dusk now, and the deck of the motor
boat showed dim under the gathering shadows of
the night. While the lads sat there, listening, Captain
Joe, the bulldog, ran to the closed door and
sniffed suspiciously.</p>

<p>“There’s some one out on deck!” Case exclaimed,
then. “I wonder if that fellow has had the nerve to
come back here? I’ll go and see who it is, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you wait and see what he will do?”
asked Clay. “If he thinks we’re the robbers, he’ll
show himself directly. If it is only a sneak thief,
he’ll take a jump in the river the minute he knows
we are aware of his presence on the deck. Give him
a chance!”</p>

<p>Then three words came in a whisper from the
outside of the door. They were spoken in a trembling
voice, accompanied by a soft knock on the
lower panel.</p>

<p>“Let me in!” the voice said. It seemed like the
voice of a child, too.</p>

<p>“Come on in, if you want to!” Alex. answered.
“This seems to be our reception day!”</p>

<p>“Sure! Come on in! Don’t be so mysterious
about it, whoever you are!”</p>

<p>As he spoke Case arose and opened the door.
Instantly there tumbled into the cabin a boy of
twelve or fourteen—a slender, thin-faced lad whose
whole appearance indicated little food and little
parental care. He did not rise to his feet.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” asked Clay, taking the intruder
by the arm. “Why don’t you get up and
introduce yourself? What do you want here, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Don’t switch on the light!” the boy pleaded, as
Clay stretched his hand toward the electric switch.
“They are watching the boat from the pier, and I
don’t want them to know I got in. That’s why I
didn’t stand up when the door was opened. The
railing of the deck protected me from the view of
any one up there. I’m running away!”</p>

<p>“You look the part!” Clay observed, motioning
the visitor to a chair. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Because they’ll make me tell who stole the
diamonds and furs up at Rock Island,” was the
hesitating reply. “They’ll put me in jail if I don’t
tell!”</p>

<p>“If you know and won’t tell,” Clay observed,
“they surely will put you in jail!”</p>

<p>“Why won’t you tell?” asked Alex. “Perhaps
you helped do the job yourself!”</p>

<p>“No I didn’t!” the boy said.</p>

<p>He was about to say more when there came another
voice from outside—a slow, steady voice demanding
attention.</p>

<p>“Listen, you kids in there,” the voice said.
“Listen, and I’ll tell you what to do to save a couple
of lives!”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink02'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER II—ALEX. GOES FISHING</a></h2>

<p>“Things seem to be coming our way!” Alex.
observed. “Can either of you boys see the fellow
who is doing the talking?”</p>

<p>Clay stepped to the cabin door and opened it.
The night had fallen swiftly, and the deck was quite
dark. The boy started toward the switch which
controlled the prow light, but the voice checked him,
coming, not from the pier, but from the water at
the side of the motor boat.</p>

<p>“Don’t turn on any lights!” the voice said.
“I’m right here under the overhang. I came to ask
you to do me a favor! You look like decent sort of
chaps!”</p>

<p>“Thanks for the compliment!” Alex. put in, from
the cabin door, where he stood with a freckled nose
wrinkled to its full capacity—and then a little more!</p>

<p>“Keep still a minute, can’t you?” demanded
Clay. “Let us see what it is the man wants us to
do for him. Why don’t you come on deck?” the
boy added, bending over in the hope of getting a
view of the strange visitor.</p>

<p>“I don’t come on deck,” was the reply, “because
I’m not lookin’ for trouble! I’m in bad here,
strangers, an’ I want you to take the boy down the
river with you!”</p>

<p>The lad who had recently come on board now
came up to the cabin door and stood in a listening
attitude. In the deep dusk his face could not be
seen plainly, but Alex., who stood close to his side,
knew that he was shaking with the chill of the water.</p>

<p>“The boy says he is running away,” objected
Clay, bending still lower over the deck railing.
“We are not going to aid in any such a game,” he
added.</p>

<p>“Shucks!” came the answer, still from the water.
“He ain’t got nobody nor nothin’ to run away from,
that kid ain’t! Hide him until you get out of Cairo,
an’ then I may be able to do something for him.”</p>

<p>“What’s the answer?” Alex. cut in. “Why
should he want to be hidden? Perhaps you’re the
man that robbed the warehouse at Rock Island!
He just told us that he knew who did it! Come on
deck, and we’ll talk it over.”</p>

<p>“If you want to get away from Cairo without
sampling all the jails in the county,” the unseen
man continued, “you’ll slip anchor an’ get down
the river right soon! The men who are watchin’
you are comin’ down the pier now. I reckon they
saw me talking from the bosom of the river. Before
I duck under an’ head for Missouri, I’ll tell you
that the kid you’ve got there is O. K. Take him
along with you!”</p>

<p>Then, much to the amazement of the boys on the
motor boat, a shot came out of the darkness in the
direction of the pier, and a bullet cut the water close
to where the man lay, near the prow, half afloat and
half clinging to the hull of the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“You see!” the unseen man said. “Drop down
until this excitement is over!”</p>

<p>“That’s a cheerful kind of a merman,” Alex. declared.
“He heard the shot and took his own advice
to disappear, anyway! What do you think of
him? Heading a lot of gunmen in this direction an’
then advising us to run away!”</p>

<p>For a moment nothing was heard save the sighing
of the wind and the wash of the river. Lights
were showing in the city, which was not far from
the pier, and one large street lamp disclosed the
figures of a dozen men running toward the motor
boat! The man who had done the shooting stood
near the foot of the pier, a revolver in his hand.
Clay sprang for the switch which controlled the
prow light.</p>

<p>“That’s more like it!” came a voice from the
shore, as the light flared out on the cluttered pier
and the swirling waters of the river. “Why didn’t
you do that before?”</p>

<p>“Quit your shooting and come on board!”
Clay advised. “We understand the use of firearms
ourselves! Come aboard and tell us what all this
is about.”</p>

<p>“We’ll come, fast enough!” said one of the advancing
party. “Keep your lights on.”</p>

<p>In a minute more the little motor boat was
crowded with rough-looking men, all armed, and all
insisting that every nook and corner of the <i>Rambler</i>
should be searched.</p>

<p>The boys offered no objections, but sat on the
deck railing waiting for the men to perform their
task and go away. Captain Joe and Teddy, however,
objected strenuously, and it required the
efforts of all four, before the search was completed,
to keep the pets from being shot by those whose legs
had been nipped by sharp teeth.</p>

<p>Finally one of the men, who seemed to be in command,
demanded of Clay:</p>

<p>“Where did the boy who came on board go?”</p>

<p>“He must have gone into the river,” was the
reply. “Just after the shooting I looked for him,
but he was not here. Who is he, and what is he
wanted for?”</p>

<p>“He belongs to the man who robbed the warehouse
office up at Rock Island,” was the gruff reply.
“If you shelter him you’ll be breaking the law.
What was that swimmer saying to you?” the fellow
continued. “That’s the man we want! Why
should he come to you, anyway?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why he should come to us any
more than I know why you men should come on
board with your insulting suspicions,” Clay answered.
“When you make up your minds that
neither the man nor the boy is here, we’ll go on
down the river.”</p>

<p>The search continued for some moments, and
the men reluctantly went ashore.</p>

<p>“Honest!” Alex. then asked of Clay. “Honest,
now! Where did the boy go?”</p>

<p>“He must have taken a jump into the river,” was
the boy’s reply. “He certainly is not on board the
<i>Rambler</i>. He just disappeared when those men
appeared.”</p>

<p>“Then he’s probably drowned!” Alex. commented.
“No one could swim long in that current.
And the man, too, probably went under! Too
bad!” he added, soberly.</p>

<p>“Well,” Clay declared, “I’ve got enough of the
hospitality of this city. Suppose we drop down to-night?
It will be risky sailing because of the flood,
but at the same time it may keep us all out of jail.
Those men may come back after they get a few
more drinks.”</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> was a staunch little motor boat,
fully competent to make her way in almost any body
of water, but the boys were afraid of driftwood and
wreckage, and also of running off into bayous which
ran out into swamps for miles, with almost as
strong a current as the main channel. Those who
have read previous volumes of this series will doubtless
recall the adventures of the four boys in Brazil
on the Amazon river, on the Columbia river, far up
in British Columbia, and on the Colorado river, as
far up as the Grand Canyon.</p>

<p>A month before that night in Cairo, the boys had
launched the motor boat on the Mississippi far up
near its source. They had struggled with sandbars
and falls, but had at last worked round the Falls of
St. Anthony and struck better water. They had
met with plenty of adventures on the way, but nothing
of the character of the happenings of that evening.
The portion of their journey really worthy of
record begins at Cairo on this early November night.</p>

<p>The pets, of which the boys were very fond, had,
as already stated by one of the boys, been acquired
in Brazil and British Columbia, Captain Joe having
been bought by Alex. at Para, and Teddy having
been rescued from a tree wreck in the great river of
the north. Both animals had been taught all sorts
of tricks by the boys.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, about our being in danger
here,” Case observed, “but, at the same time, if we
leave now, in the night, with the river up, we shall
only confirm the suspicions of those on shore. Suppose
we move away from this pier, so as to be out of
the way of the mob, and anchor in another place,
where those whose duty it is to look up suspicious
river boats can find us if they desire to? For one,
I don’t like the idea of being chased down the river.”</p>

<p>“Solomon had nothing on you!” Alex. agreed.
“We may as well remain here until morning. I
must confess that I don’t like the way the Father of
Waters is acting!”</p>

<p>“Well, let us get somewhere and settle down for
the night!” Jule suggested. “I’m still hungry!
Those fellows spoiled my supper. Who wants more
ham?”</p>

<p>“Say,” Alex. cried, with one of his inimitable
grins, “why not have a fish for supper? I won’t be
able to sleep much, on account of watching, and
may as well have a good square meal! Then I’ll sit
up and you boys can go to bed.”</p>

<p>“Where can you get a fish to-night?” demanded
Jule. “Think one is going to climb up on the deck?
Ham is good enough for me right now!”</p>

<p>But Alex. did not abandon the idea of having a
fish supper. After the <i>Rambler</i> had been taken a
short distance up the river and anchored in a little
bay which promised protection from the rushing
current, loaded at times with driftwood and the
wreck of houses and barns, the lad again broached
the subject.</p>

<p>“I can get the rowboat out,” he insisted, “and
let her down stream with a line. Then I can fish
under that bank to the east. Don’t you ever think
all the river fish have moved into top flats because of
the flood! I saw one jump up just a moment ago!
You boys keep a good fire and I’ll guarantee to bring
the fish!”</p>

<p>“Go it!” Clay laughed. “I wouldn’t go out in
a rowboat for a dozen fish suppers, but you seem
to have the luck of the Irish on such occasions, so get
to going!”</p>

<p>“You’ll eat the fish, all right!” Alex. taunted,
“so help me get the boat down.”</p>

<p>The skiff was lowered from the roof of the little
cabin and placed in the water, with a great splash.
It tugged and strained at the cord which held it, and
now and then received severe bumps from floating
debris, but Alex. insisted on drawing it up and
jumping in. Then he set about getting his fish for
supper!</p>

<p>For a long time the boy fished without receiving
any intimation that there was a fish left in the river!
The boat caught plenty of driftwood, however. At
times great masses of trees and timbers would go
sailing down, advancing out of the darkness into
the circle of light about the <i>Rambler</i> as if brought
to life by the presence of mankind. Then the darkness
would receive them again and the water would
run clear for a time.</p>

<p>The little bay where the <i>Rambler</i> was moored
was in a measure out of the sweep of the strong
current, still the water eddied and swirled around
the little rowboat in a threatening manner.
Sometimes the boy had all he could do to keep the craft
from turning turtle and dumping him into the river.
The other boys, watching from the deck of the
motor boat, often called to him to draw up on the
line in order to avoid a mass of wreckage drifting
that way.</p>

<p>The strong, high prow-light of the motor boat
cast a sharp illumination over the river for some
distance up stream, revealing the approach of dangerous
wreckage, and the lone fisherman was often
glad to heed the warnings of his chums. At last,
however, just as he was playing a fish which seemed
to him as large as a whale, and twice as ferocious,
he heard a call which he disregarded for a second.</p>

<p>“There’s a roof coming down!” Clay shouted
to the boy. “It is likely to pay you a visit! Better
come aboard!”</p>

<p>“And there’s something moving on it!” Jule
shouted. “It looks like a baby!”</p>

<p>Alex. was busy with his line. The fish supper was
almost in sight! If he heard what was said to him
he did not heed the warning, for he kept on playing
his fish, which seemed inclined to take the rowboat
down the river to the Gulf of Mexico!</p>

<p>The piece of roof to which the boys pointed
swung around the side of the <i>Rambler</i> and was
pulled in toward the shore by the eddy which had
drawn so many lesser objects in. Then, for the
first time, Alex. saw his danger. If the mass struck
the boat it might crush it. At the very least it
would be likely to break the line with which it was
attached to the <i>Rambler</i> and send him adrift!</p>

<p>The boy seized the cable and began to draw the
boat up to the <i>Rambler</i>, seeking protection under its
bulk. Then he heard a cry come from the raft, and
saw a mite of a boy reaching out his hands. The
boat dropped back and the mass, edging in below the
<i>Rambler</i>, struck it full on the prow!</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink03'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER III—A WAIF FROM THE RIVER</a></h2>

<p>The cable tying the rowboat to the <i>Rambler</i>
parted with a snap as the wreckage struck the light
craft, and Alex. went rocking and bobbing down
toward the Gulf of Mexico! The boys on the
<i>Rambler</i> saw him get out an oar to secure steerway,
though he was pressed on by the house roof which
had done the mischief.</p>

<p>It was not a flat roof, but one with two steep
sides and a sharp apex. It rode the current apex up,
as if floating on a floor crossing under the eaves.
On the top of the ridge-boards, clinging on with
hands and bare heels, and shouting fit to wake the
people of Cairo, the lads on the <i>Rambler</i> saw a half-dressed
negro boy of perhaps ten or eleven years.
The more the roof bobbed on the waves the louder
he yelled.</p>

<p>When the line snapped Clay rushed to the motors
and turned on full power. The <i>Rambler</i> trembled
as she thrust her nose against the current, wavered,
and then, answering her helm, swung around
broadside to the sweep of water, shook a mass of wreckage
from her prow, as a dog shakes off water, and
edged down stream.</p>

<p>In a minute after the accident the powerful motor
boat was chasing Alex., the little negro boy, and the
teetering roof down toward Memphis! It was dark
on the river, and the roaring of the waters made the
prospect doubly disagreeable. The current was running
fast, and that one minute of getting under way
had swept the rowboat some distance down stream.
Still it was just visible under the strong prow light.</p>

<p>“There’s Alex.’s fish!” shouted Chase, pointing
to the cowering negro boy on the apex of the roof.
“Wonder how he wants him cooked for supper?”</p>

<p>“The last find Alex. made,” Jule laughed, “was a
bear! What will he be finding next? S-a-a-y, you
coon!” he called out, shaping his hands for a trumpet
in order to direct his voice, “don’t you go to
dropping off! We’ll pick you up with the motor
boat,” he continued, as the little fellow began scrambling
toward the water’s edge.</p>

<p>“There he goes!” shouted Clay, as the negro
boy, not heeding Jule’s directions, went clattering
down the shingles and dropped into the river.
“The little fellow was afraid we would go away
and leave him! What do you think of that?” he
added. “The coon is swimming like a fish to the
rowboat!”</p>

<p>The boy would have reached the rowboat handily
if a heavy piece of timber had not intervened. It
struck him head-on as he swam, and he went under
the brown waters. Then the boys on the <i>Rambler</i>
saw Alex. throw off his coat, take the broken line
between his teeth, and dive into the river, just missing
the great timber as he went headfirst into the
flood! There was a growl and a snarl on deck, and
then Captain Joe and Teddy Bear were both in the
river, swimming down toward the swaying roof.</p>

<p>The bulldog, with the instinct of the intelligent
canine, doubtless recognized the peril of the situation
and took to the water on an errand of rescue,
but with the bear it was different. He had been
patiently taught to bathe and play in the water with
the boys, and now he saw only a frolic ahead!</p>

<p>However this may be, it was the bear cub who
seized the negro boy as he came to the surface, half
supported by Alex.’s arm. The little fellow had not
been rendered unconscious by the blow he had received,
and was able to sustain himself in the water
as soon as he came to the surface.</p>

<p>Alex. was busy hauling the boat back, or trying
to, with the end of the line in one hand, and Captain
Joe swam directly to him. He knew that if he released
the line the rowboat would drift away, leaving
him and his companions to be rescued by the
<i>Rambler</i>, and he had a stubborn notion that he would
like to get out of the mess without the assistance of
his chums! They would then have no opportunity
to make sly remarks about his skill as a fisherman!
The fishline was wound around his left arm, and he
believed that the fish he had been playing when the
accident took place was still on the hook!</p>

<p>The situation was clearing, for Alex. held to the
line, and boy, bear, dog, and frightened negro boy,
were doing very well in the swift current when
another mass of wreckage came sweeping down
upon them. As it came down Alex. dove under, and
the negro boy started to do the same, but just then
his eyes fell on the bear, hanging to his arm, and
with a scream which only half disclosed how scared
he was he scrambled on the floating heap of brush
and was swept down stream!</p>

<p>His round eyes were, apparently, as large as saucers
and as white as chalk as he turned to see Teddy
Bear pursuing him to his place of refuge. Familiar
with the water game, the bear chased the negro boy
to the limit of the wreckage and pushed him in with
his nose. By this time Alex. was clinging to the
rowboat, with Captain Joe serving as chaperon, and
the <i>Rambler</i> was at hand, the boys on board cheering
Teddy and the negro boy as they chased around
the brush heap from which they had been pitched
into the river. Although they called out to the boy
not to be afraid of the bear, his cries rose above the
roar of the waters!</p>

<p>Alex. and Captain Joe were picked up first, the
rowboat made secure, and then the <i>Rambler</i> rounded
the floating mass of brush and took Teddy on board.
The little fellow scrambled away from the hands
reached out to grasp him, his eyes following the
figure of the bear as it was lifted on deck.</p>

<p>“Fo’ de Lawd’s sake!” he gasped, his eyes
round and white, “don’ yo’ feed dis coon to dat
bear! He sure done eat dis chile!”</p>

<p>When passed up to the deck the boy gave one look
at the bear, let out another yell of fright, and, ducking
into the cabin, dodged under the table, where he
crouched on hands and knees, his eyes sticking out
like white doorknobs. The boys were too full of
laugh for the time being to try to explain matters
to him.</p>

<p>As soon as Alex. was on deck he began unwinding
the fishline from his arm. Then he played it over
the side of the boat, much to the amusement of his
chums.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you think I didn’t catch a fish?” the
lad demanded, with a wink at Clay.</p>

<p>“If you didn’t get a fish,” laughed Clay, “it is
about the only thing you didn’t bring out of the
river with you! We fished out a bear, a dog, and a
baby coon with you! You surely ought to have a
fish!”</p>

<p>And Alex. did have a fish! It was firmly hooked,
and came flopping out of the water when he drew in
the line. Still under the table, with his eyes on the
bear, the rescued negro boy licked his chops when he
saw it. Clay observed the action and went to him.
After a time the little fellow was coaxed out of his
hiding-place.</p>

<p>“That’s a pet bear!” explained Clay. “He
won’t bite you!”</p>

<p>The boy seemed to want to believe the other, for
the sake of the fish supper which appeared to be
coming soon, but he edged away from the cub, all
the same!</p>

<p>“You hungry?” asked Case, coming up.</p>

<p>The little fellow nodded, and Case went on.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Abraham Lincoln Charles Sumner Horace
Greeley Banks!”</p>

<p>The little chap repeated the names in a sing-song
tone, with the air of one who had been carefully
drilled in the repetition. The boys broke into
shouts of laughter, and even Teddy Bear nosed his
way through the little group and stood gazing at the
negro boy with reproving eyes! The boy tried to
dodge away, but Clay held him fast.</p>

<p>“Jerusalem!” Case cried, as soon as he could control
his voice. “What a name! Where did you get
it, chile?”</p>

<p>“Mah mammy done ’stowed it on me!” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“Well, it is too long,” Clay decided, “so we’ll
just call you Mose! Do you happen to be hungry,
little one?” he added, with a glance at the fish.</p>

<p>In answer the boy laid his hands on the region of
his stomach and grinned.</p>

<p>“Where do you live?” asked Alex., ringing the
water out of his clothes, which had been removed as
soon as he reached the deck. “What will your
mammy say to your going off on the river? She’ll
wallop you, chile, good an’ plenty!”</p>

<p>“I done run away!” answered the boy.</p>

<p>“That’s two to-night!” grinned Alex., preparing
to dress the fish for supper. “How many more are
we likely to find before we get to the Gulf?”</p>

<p>Teddy Bear, who seemed to feel that he was deserving
of some attention for having rescued Mose
from instant death in the river, now came up and
brushed his soft nose over the boys’ hand. Mose’s
eyes grew wider, but, seeing that the bear did not
offer to bite, he ventured to stroke his head,
whereat the cub sat up on his hind feet and asked to
have a boxing lesson!</p>

<p>“That bear is a spoiled child!” Case remarked,
as Teddy began sparing. “He is no good at all—just
a clown!”</p>

<p>“Where did you run from?” asked Jule, anxious
to know more of the negro boy.</p>

<p>“San Louee,” was the reply. “I done lived on
th’ levee!”</p>

<p>“From St. Louis, eh?” Clay said. “Where do
you want to go?”</p>

<p>“I done hire out to you all,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Of course!” Alex. laughed. “Didn’t we bring
him up out of the waters? He’ll make a fine playmate
for Teddy Bear!”</p>

<p>“If he doesn’t disappear, as that other waif did,”
smiled Clay.</p>

<p>“Where do you suppose that boy went to?”
asked Alex. “He never swam to shore, that is, to
the other shore, and if he had landed on the pier
when the men came on board they would certainly
have seen him. I reckon the darkness just ate
him!”</p>

<p>“And the man who came to speak a good word
for him!” Clay went on. “If he had been the
thief wanted for the Rock Island diamond and fur
robbery, he couldn’t have been more mysterious.
The boy said he would be made to tell about the
robbery if they found him, and this man wanted to
get him out of the way, so I guess we can put the
pieces together and patch out the truth. The man
is one of the robbers and the boy belongs to
him!”</p>

<p>“If I had the Sherlock genius you toss out so
easily,” Jule cut in, “I’d put it in a book. Why
should the robber come to us to speak a good word
for the boy? He ought to have known that we’d
see through the game.”</p>

<p>“He may not be the robber at all,” Case observed.
“There was some mystery connected with the two,
and that’s all we know about it! The man is gone,
and the boy is gone, and they are probably drowned,
so we may as well count the story closed.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go you a dinner at the Bismark, as soon as
we get back to Chicago,” Clay insisted, “that we
find both the man and the boy before we get down
to the Gulf!”</p>

<p>“You’re in for the dinners, then!” Case exclaimed.
“And now,” he went on, “what are we
going to do to-night? Are we going on down the
river, or are we going to get into some cozy little
slip and anchor for the second time?”</p>

<p>“I’m no good Solomon on an empty stomach,”
laughed Clay. “Wait until Alex. has his fish supper
served! You want some, too, don’t you Mose?” he
added, turning to the little fellow, who stood gazing
from the bear to the fish, now ready for the
pan.</p>

<p>“I’s done gone empty cl’ar to mah toes!” was
Mose’s reply.</p>

<p>After the fish had been eaten Mose was put to
bed in one of the bunks, and the boys decided to go
on down the river. They wanted to get away from
any such entanglement as had been suggested by the
visit of the officers and the search of the motor
boat.</p>

<p>They made a long distance with little trouble, as
they were going with the driftwood, and at daylight
tied up in a small bayou, at the end of which a deserted
old house stood lowering down upon the
flood with a touch of mystery in the broken windows
and overhanging eaves!</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink04'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER IV—TWO BOYS GET A TUMBLE</a></h2>

<p>“I’d give a cent to know just where we are!” Jule
declared, as he stood on the deck of the <i>Rambler</i>,
waiting for Case’s call to breakfast, the advance
odors of which were creeping out of the cabin,
where Mose and Teddy Bear lay on a rug together,
evidently the very best of friends!</p>

<p>“Give me the coin, then,” Alex. exclaimed. “We
are about ten or fifteen miles below Hickman, Kentucky,
and we are on the Missouri side; and there’s
a loop of river which runs north a long way and
comes back again. Some day the Mississippi will
cut through the neck of land, and then there’ll be
another large island, with houses set back from the
river a long distance! Give me the cent!”</p>

<p>Jule gravely passed the coin over to Alex., who
as gravely pocketed it, and drew Jule to a seat beside
himself on the gunwale of the boat. Captain Joe
came up to the boys as they sat there and wagged
his tail, his nose pointing toward the deserted old
house at the end of the bayou.</p>

<p>“Do you see what the bulldog wants?” Alex.
asked, in a moment.</p>

<p>“He wants a run on shore,” replied Jule. “He
wants to get off the boat and do stunts on the grass.
I’m with him in that, too!”</p>

<p>“He’s pointing to the old house!” Alex. suggested,
with a grin.</p>

<p>“Good idea!” winked Jule. “Suppose we go
over to the ranch and see what sort of a place it
is? We’ll just sneak off after breakfast and be
back in an hour.”</p>

<p>“Right,” agreed Alex. “We may find a buried
treasure! Or plunder from the Rock Island warehouse
may be hidden in some dusty attic! What?
That sounds like a story of John Paul Jones, out
of a book!”</p>

<p>“I reckon all we’ll find will be rats,” the practical
Jule replied. “But I like to ramble over old houses.
It evidently used to stand on the bank of the river,
but some washout left it back so far that it was
deserted. It looks like there might be ghosts hiding
in it right now! Do you hear anything?” the boy
added, as he bent his ear toward the neglected mansion,
sinking to decay now for many a long year.
“Do you hear anything that sounds uncanny? I
thought I heard a ghost call!”</p>

<p>“I half believe you mean it!” laughed Alex.
“I believe you really think you hear something
ghostly! If I were rich once for every ghost there
is in the world, I wouldn’t have a cent to my name!
What does this ghost call sound like?” added the
boy.</p>

<p>“It sounded like a long, low call for help!” was
the reply. “I believe all the calls from deserted
houses are long and low, what?”</p>

<p>“Right you are!” Alex. answered. “Say, what’s
the matter of taking Captain Joe with us when we
go to the house? If there’s a ghost behind the casings,
he’ll be certain to find and bring it out to us!”</p>

<p>“Then I’m strong for Captain Joe!” cried Jule.
“We’ll bring the perturbed spirit on board and put
it with our collection of animals! And there’s the
breakfast call, at last!” he continued, whereat both
boys rushed into the cabin.</p>

<p>Clay, who had been tinkering around the motors
for half an hour, entered the cabin before breakfast
was over, his face looking troubled, his clothing
smeared with grease.</p>

<p>“I have an idea that we’ll stop here a few days
until some one goes to one of the towns hereabouts
and brings back some bolts,” he said. “The motors
are out of whack, and ought not to be operated in
the shape they are in.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go back to Hickman in the rowboat,” declared
Case. “I have a notion that I’d like to see
the town.”</p>

<p>“And row against that current?” asked Alex.
“I see you doing it!”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t do it in a thousand years!” Jule
observed.</p>

<p>“Well,” Case went on, looking at his map of the
river, “there’s New Madrid, on the Missouri side.
I might walk up there and back in a day.”</p>

<p>“Up there?” laughed Alex., looking over Case’s
shoulder. “Why do you say up there? New
Madrid is north from here, all right, but it is down
stream, for all that!”</p>

<p>“Well, walk down there, then!” Case replied.
“I want to learn something about that robbery anyway,
and there may be news of it; besides, a walk
along the river will be a sort of a picnic. It isn’t
more than ten or twelve miles to the town.”</p>

<p>“Then you’d better arrange to return to-morrow,”
Clay advised. “You are not used to such
long walks. We are in no hurry to go on, for we
have all the time there is until this time next year!”</p>

<p>So it was finally arranged that Case should walk
down to New Madrid and get the needed repairs
for the motors, while the others looked over the
country which lay about them. When Alex. suggested
the visit to the deserted house, Clay was anxious
to become one of the party. He said he had
had the same idea in his mind ever since seeing the
old place.</p>

<p>“After Case goes,” Jule suggested, “that would
leave only Mose and Teddy Bear on board the
<i>Rambler</i>. I don’t believe it is safe to leave her
alone.”</p>

<p>“Of course it isn’t,” Clay admitted, “so I’ll remain
here to-day and visit the old building to-morrow.
Then you two boys can remain at home.”</p>

<p>Everything being satisfactorily arranged, Alex.
and Jule started away up the bayou in the rowboat.
The old basin was full of water, and so there was
little current, which made it easy rowing. In half
an hour they were at the foot of an old pier, slanting
over on weak legs like a tipsy man. It was plain
that the landing had not been used for commercial
purposes for a long time.</p>

<p>The boys fastened the boat and ran briskly up the
rotting footway which led to the enclosure in which
the old house stood. There was a wilderness of
trees and shrubs in the enclosure, and the walks,
which had evidently once been carefully tended,
were now overgrown with weeds and long grass.
Lizards darted out of unseen places and sped away
as the boys advanced along a broken walk which
led to the front door of the mansion.</p>

<p>At the very threshold the boys paused, listening.
The ragged blinds were flapping in the breeze, and
the trees which rimmed the enclosure rustled and
creaked in a most uncanny way, but these sounds
were not the ones which brought the adventurous
boys to a halt.</p>

<p>The noise they heard sounded like the tones of a
violin, coming from a great distance. The notes,
faint, sweet, perplexing, rose and fell on the wind,
now lifting into a weird song, now dropping to the
softest melody!</p>

<p>“There’s some one here, after all!” Jule suggested,
though there was a question in the way the
words were spoken. “Some one lives here? What
do you think?”</p>

<p>Alex. pointed to the broken door which opened
into the disordered hall, to the window blinds, beating
the casings at the will of the wind, and at the
long grass and weeds growing between the planks
and stones of the walks.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe any one lives here!” he insisted.</p>

<p>“Then what is it making the music?” demanded
Jule. “If that isn’t some one playing the violin you
may eat my head for a cabbage!”</p>

<p>They listened again. The sounds stopped directly,
then there came a banging of doors and a
rustle, as if some one in trailing clothes was being
dragged through the hall. Then a shriek which appeared
to come from directly under the feet of the
boys cut the air, lifting into a terrifying yell at the
end. The lads involuntarily started back down the
path, but both stopped and faced the house again.</p>

<p>“I’m not going away without knowing more
about it!” Alex. declared.</p>

<p>“That’s the way I look at it!” grinned Jule.
“We can’t turn tail and run like a couple of
cowards. I wish we had brought Captain Joe along
with us!”</p>

<p>“Clay wanted him for company,” Alex. explained.
“Joe looked like his heart was broken
when we came off without him! I’ll bet he runs
away and comes after us!”</p>

<p>Seeing that their automatic revolvers were in
working order, the boys walked back up the broken
walk, mounted the steps, and passed into the ancient
hallway of the mansion. All was ruin and decay
there. The floor was broken out in places, and there
were marks of an axe on the casings of the door and
on the narrow windows beside it.</p>

<p>The stairway leading to the rooms above was
broken, too, some of the steps being gone entirely.
The lads stopped at the foot of the steps for an instant
to gaze upward and then turned into a lofty
room on the left. This must have been the parlor,
and the apartment beyond it must have been the
library.</p>

<p>The furniture, which had once been valuable, was
broken into bits, and a charred spot on the floor
showed where a fire had been kindled. The rooms
on that floor were all desolate and dismantled, and
the boys soon turned their attention to those above
the ruined staircase.</p>

<p>Scarcely had they gained the head of the stairs
when the music began again. It seemed to come
down the wide hallway which ran nearly through
the house parallel with the front.</p>

<p>“We’re getting nearer to the band!” Jule whispered.</p>

<p>There was such a hush over the place, such a
weird, uncanny atmosphere, that, somehow, the boys
did not feel like being loud-voiced or boisterous.</p>

<p>“We’ll be running into a reception committee
next!” Alex. returned.</p>

<p>The music continued for a few seconds, then
ended in a repetition of the dragging, rustling sound
and the shriek which had been heard before. This
time the noise indicating physical motion appeared
to come from the very hallway where the boys were
standing!</p>

<p>Alex. and Jule continued on through the hall
until they came to a partition which shut off the
north end of it. There was a door in this partition,
but it was locked. At first all the efforts of the lads
failed to budge it.</p>

<p>“There’s one part of the ranch that hasn’t rotted
away,” Alex. observed, as red-faced and perspiring,
he paused in his attack on the door.</p>

<p>“That shows there’s some one taking care of it,”
Jule decided. “Suppose we try the door once more?
It ought to give way before our weight.”</p>

<p>They both threw their shoulders against the upper
panels and they dropped back, revealing a small
room which had the appearance of having recently
been occupied. There was a wide fireplace at the
back of the room, which was at the end of the house,
and a chair standing near the hearth was softly
cushioned. There was a window on each side of the
fireplace, but the curtains were drawn so all the details
of the apartment were not visible. The boys
drew back for an instant.</p>

<p>“We’re breaking into some one’s house!” Jule
whispered.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s right!” Alex. returned. “What
ought we to do now?”</p>

<p>“Keep right on until we get at the solution of
the mystery,” Jule answered. “It may be that we
shall find a maiden in distress, and——”</p>

<p>The boy stopped in the midst of his light-hearted
speech and looked again through the broken panels
of the door at the end of the hall. What he saw was
a side door opening.</p>

<p>As the door swung back an old man, white haired
and walking with a stout cane, came into the room
and sat down in the chair by the hearth. Then,
without glancing toward the broken panels and the
boys beyond, he spoke:</p>

<p>“The door is not fastened, boys. You are welcome
to enter.”</p>

<p>The boys entered, feeling ashamed and half
afraid, and the old man pointed to two chairs by the
hearth which had not been seen through the broken
door.</p>

<p>“Sit down!” he said, almost with an air of command,
“and tell me why you are here.”</p>

<p>The boys sank down into the chairs; then there
came a sharp click, and they felt themselves falling
through the floor!</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink05'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER V—A NEW CAPTAIN ON BOARD</a></h2>

<p>Clay continued his work on the motors for a
long time after the departure of Alex. and Jule.
It was impossible to make them work with safety
without the repairs Case had gone after, but the
boy decided that the present would be a fine time to
clean them.</p>

<p>While he worked, polishing and oiling, Mose and
Teddy came out of the cabin arm-in-arm! At least
the little negro boy had one arm around the cub’s
neck!</p>

<p>“You’ve got over your scare, eh?” Clay laughed,
as the two came to his side.</p>

<p>“Ah sure tu’n white las’ night!” Mose declared,
rolling his eyes until they looked like white billiard
balls. “Ah’s so scared!”</p>

<p>“You are black enough this morning,” Clay suggested.
“Where did you come from?”</p>

<p>“Ah done come f’m San Louee,” was the reply.
“Ah lib on de levee.”</p>

<p>“Did you run away from St. Louis?” asked
Clay. “Did you come all the way from the levee
on the roof Alex. fished you off from?”</p>

<p>Mose, still playing with the cub, explained that he
had sneaked on board a steamer at St. Louis, but
had been put ashore at a landing above Cairo by the
mate. Then, so great had been his desire to get
farther south for the winter, he had taken a drifting
boat and pushed out into the swollen stream.</p>

<p>The boat had been crushed in a mass of wreckage,
but the boy had managed to crawl up on the floating
roof where he had been found. The mammy he had
spoken of as having been so liberal with him in the
bestowal of names was an old colored lady who
had given him a place to sleep on cold nights and
occasionally fed him when he was hungry. He
knew nothing of his parents or any relatives. He
was just a levee waif.</p>

<p>After a time Clay went to the cabin and lay on his
bunk, which let down from the ceiling, being usually
drawn up during the daytime. The motors were
still under process of cleaning, and various parts lay
scattered about.</p>

<p>Presently the boy heard a great racket on deck.
Captain Joe’s deep voice came in threatening growls,
and Mose and Teddy scampered into the cabin.
Clay sprang to his feet and made for the deck, not
doubting that Alex. and Jule had returned and were
up to some mischief. Before he reached the door
he heard the sound of a heavy blow.</p>

<p>He could see no one through the doorway, which
Mose had left open, although most of the deck was
in sight, yet the blow he had heard warned him that
something out of the ordinary was taking place.
He stepped back to a shelf for his revolver.</p>

<p>He knew that during floods bands of outlaws
frequented the river in quest of plunder, and it was
his first impression that one of these had discovered
the motor boat and was trying to board her. He
wondered at the silence of the dog.</p>

<p>As the boy reached for his weapon, a gruff voice
from the cabin doorway commanded him to face
about and hold up his hands.</p>

<p>“And hold ’em up empty, too!” the gruff voice
said.</p>

<p>There was nothing for Clay to do but to obey.
It was with an effort, however, that he kept his
arms extended. The leering eyes of the man with
the face of a fox who stood before him with a revolver
pushed almost into his face caused such hot
surges of rage to fill the boy’s brain that he came
near facing the peril and springing upon the outlaw.</p>

<p>Mose, levee bred and wise to the unlawful purpose
of the intruder, moved stealthily toward the
shelf where Clay’s revolver lay, in plain sight. In
another second it would have been in the little fellow’s
hand, with what result Clay could not imagine,
but the outlaw saw the movement and edged
forward, still keeping the revolver leveled at Clay,
much to the latter’s disgust.</p>

<p>“Here, you coon!” the man shouted, “get over
in that corner and stay there! Move, or I’ll give you
a lift!”</p>

<p>The brute gave Mose a savage kick in the side as
he spoke. It was one thing for Clay to be placed in
a humiliating position, to be threatened with a gun,
but it was quite another for him to stand inactive
and see a boy brutally treated! Disregarding all
his thoughts of the uselessness of the move, the boy
sprang at the outlaw.</p>

<p>Although only a boy, Clay was muscular and in
training. The man he had attacked was stronger
and heavier than the lad, but he was slower of movement,
and the result of the conflict might have been
a victory for Clay if the two had been permitted to
continue the struggle unmolested.</p>

<p>While the meager furniture of the little cabin was
being broken and tossed hither and yon by the
combatants, while Teddy was jumping about, eager
to get hold of one of the fighters—as he had been
taught to do when the boys were wrestling—and
while Mose was doing his best to get over to the
shelf where the revolver lay, there came a quick
jar on deck, a jar caused by the bunting of a boat
against the hull of the <i>Rambler</i>, and then hurrying
footsteps on the forward deck.</p>

<p>Clay fought all the harder when the sounds
reached his ears, for he was sure that Alex. and
Jule had returned, and that short work would now
be made of the intruder. He was gradually securing
a hold on his enemy which would have ended the
battle when he was seized and lifted—by a giant, it
seemed to him—clear of the cabin deck and held
there while the outlaw slowly regained his feet and
picked up his weapon.</p>

<p>Clay saw that it was the other side that had received
the reinforcements, and motioned to Mose
to remain quiet and keep out of sight. He feared
that further activity on the part of the negro boy
would add to his punishment.</p>

<p>After catching his breath, the outlaw with whom
Clay had been struggling lifted a pair of bloodshot
eyes to Clay’s face and sprang at him, his huge fists
clenched until the knuckles showed hard and white.</p>

<p>“You bum!” he shouted, lunging at the lad,
“I’ll give you some of your own medicine! What
do you mean by striking me?”</p>

<p>The blow would have landed squarely in the boy’s
face, but the man who had picked him off the outlaw
warded it off with a fist like a ham, and set the
boy behind the great bulk of his own person. Clay
was encouraged by this defense, and began hoping
that he had found a friend instead of another enemy.</p>

<p>But this hope was soon shattered, for the newcomer
produced a hard cord, which had evidently
once been used as a fishline, and coolly proceeded to
tie the boy’s wrists. This task completed to his
satisfaction, he pushed the boy over on his bunk
and tossed Mose on top of him.</p>

<p>“There!” he cried. “You keep quiet, or I’ll turn
Sam loose on you! And, Sam, if you molest the
boy again I’ll settle with you for it. I take it he
had a right to fight for his boat! And the little
coon! You keep your hands off him, too!”</p>

<p>The man called Sam flashed an ugly look out of
his foxy, inflamed eyes and went out on deck. In a
moment he was seen in the doorway again, dragging
Captain Joe after him.</p>

<p>“Shall I pitch the dog overboard?” he asked, in
a surly tone. “He took a piece out of my leg and
I gave him a rap on the head. He’s knocked out!”</p>

<p>Clay sat up on the bunk and glared at the man,
who was still holding the bulldog by the collar. At
that moment, whatever the consequences, the fellow’s
life would not have been worth a farthing if
the boy had had a gun!</p>

<p>“Don’t let him kill the dog!” Clay said, appealing
to the giant. “He’s a good fellow, that dog!
Of course he bit that robber! He wouldn’t have
been a good dog if he hadn’t. Take what you want
on the boat, but let the dog live.”</p>

<p>The giant, who was at least six foot six inches in
height and large in proportion, looked Captain Joe
over after the manner of one acquainted with dogs
while Clay awaited his decision anxiously.</p>

<p>“The kid is right,” he finally declared. “This is
a good dog, and we’ll keep him with us. Took a
piece out of your leg, did he?”</p>

<p>The big fellow placed his hands on his mammoth
hips, threw back his head until his hairy throat rose
like a sturdy column of strength, and poured forth
such a torrent of laughter that Teddy came out of
the cabin to see what new sport was being prepared
for his amusement. Sam struck at the cub, but the
other pushed him away before he had done any mischief.</p>

<p>“That’s a good one!” roared the giant. “Took
a piece out of your leg, did he? If he ain’t pizened,
and lives after that, I’ll keep him. There’s a heap
of pizen snakes down my way that need looking
after. Took a piece out of your leg! That’s too
good for anything! Ho! Ho! Ho! Took a piece
out of your leg!”</p>

<p>“I hope he’ll some day take a piece out of that
throat of yours!” roared Sam.</p>

<p>“No doubt, no doubt!” replied the giant. “He
may be a doin’ of it when the hangman is busy puttin’
a new hemp tie about that weazen of yours!
Now let the kids and the dog and bear alone, and
help work the boat out into the current. We’ve got
to be getting out of this!”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to put the motors together before
you move her,” Sam replied.</p>

<p>The giant looked thoughtfully at the scattered
fragments, then at Clay, still in the bunk, and
scratched a thatch of red hair which looked like a
hayrick.</p>

<p>“It seems to need puttin’ together,” he said, beckoning
to Clay.</p>

<p>Then the boy saw that it was the intention of the
outlaws to take possession of the <i>Rambler</i> and shift
her down stream before any of the boys returned.
He thought of Alex. and Jule, marooned on that
desolate point of land where the old house stood,
of Case, trudging back from New Madrid with the
repairs to find the boat gone!</p>

<p>He glanced about hopelessly, searching the shores
of the bayou on the faint chance of seeing Alex.
and Jule returning. Captain Joe was now regaining
consciousness in the cabin, and Teddy was trying
to interest him in a boxing match! Mose sat in a
corner motionless, except that his eyes rolled about
in anger or panic, the boy could not determine which.</p>

<p>“Well, get the engines together!” ordered the
giant.</p>

<p>“There are parts missing,” Clay answered.
“One of the boys has gone to New Madrid for repairs.
She won’t run a foot without them.”</p>

<p>Sam and the giant conversed together for a moment,
and then the former called out to Mose, emphasizing
his words with a threatening gesture:</p>

<p>“Here, coon!” he shouted. “Can you swim?”</p>

<p>“Ah sho’ can,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Then jump ashore and take this dog with you.
If I ever see either of you again I’ll take your hides
off!”</p>

<p>“It would improve matters to hold ’em under a
while!” he added, angrily.</p>

<p>“I won’t have it,” the giant returned. “No
murder for me!”</p>

<p>“You’ll see what’ll come of lettin’ ’em go!” Sam
warned.</p>

<p>“Git!” ordered the big fellow, in a not unkind
tone, and Mose, nothing loth, gathered the dog in
his arms and leaped into the bayou.</p>

<p>Clay almost held his breath for a moment, until
he saw that the cold water had revived the dog, and
that he was swimming. Then his attention was attracted
to the outlaws, who were, with pole and oar,
edging the <i>Rambler</i> out into the river.</p>

<p>He believed that the boat would be wrecked the
moment it, helpless, struck the mass of floodwood
sweeping down. Presently he felt the push of the
current, and the boat went whirling down stream,
tipping from side to side as she spun around, helpless
in the current.</p>

<p>Then a great tree struck the stern and half capsized
her. The end seemed at hand.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink06'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER VI—CAPTAIN JOE MAKES A HIT</a></h2>

<p>While the <i>Rambler</i>, in charge of reckless river
pirates, was swinging down with the current, threatening
to capsize every instant, Alex. and Jule sat
flat on a rotten, yielding floor somewhere in the
interior of the deserted house, feeling tenderly over
their limbs to see if they had received severe injuries
during the fall from the room where they had
been so inhospitably welcomed by the aged man.</p>

<p>The boys had not fallen far. In fact, it seemed to
them that they had only slid down a gentle incline to
the story below. A hatch in the floor in front of the
hearth had been dropped back, and their chairs had
slid into a chute which seemed, from its smoothness,
to be in frequent use.</p>

<p>For a minute the boys were alarmed, excited,
angry, then the humor of their sudden removal
from the apartment above appealed to them. Alex.
was first to speak.</p>

<p>“Vot iss?” he exclaimed. “This must be a page
of a comic section in one of the Chicago newspapers.
How many legs and arms have you
broken?”</p>

<p>“Not a one!” answered Jule. “What kind of
hospital treatment do you require?”</p>

<p>“If I felt any better,” laughed Alex., “I wouldn’t
know what to take for it.”</p>

<p>It was dark as pitch where the boys were, and
they felt about until their hands touched. The personal
contact gave them new courage.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it?” asked Jule. “This
doesn’t look good to me!”</p>

<p>“We’ve simply butted in on some other fellow’s
game,” Alex. replied. “We seem to have visited a
crank who thinks it best to be prepared in advance
for unwelcome guests.”</p>

<p>“A moonshiner or a river pirate!” Jule suggested.</p>

<p>“That’s about it!” Alex. answered. “We’ve
interrupted the industry of a set of illicit whisky
makers or warehouse thieves. The valley is said to
swarm with bandits whenever the river is out of its
banks. Now, the question is how are we going to
get out and back to the <i>Rambler</i>?”</p>

<p>They did not know that at that moment Clay and
the motor boat were in a situation far more serious
than that in which they now found themselves!</p>

<p>“I wish it wasn’t so dark here!” Jule whispered.</p>

<p>“Why the soft pedal?” asked Alex. “We’ve
got a right to talk as loudly as we like, I take it,
being alone in a dark old donjon keep!”</p>

<p>“There’s some one in the room with us!” Jule
explained, in a whisper which barely reached his
chum’s ears, so faint it was. “I hear him breathing.”</p>

<p>“Hello!” Alex. called out, then. “Hello!
Come on out an’ be a good fellow!”</p>

<p>There was no answer, and then Alex., reaching
into a capacious pocket, brought out a small electric
torch and pushed the button. On board the <i>Rambler</i>
or on shore, it was a rule of the boys never to
move about without an electric torch and an automatic
revolver ready for use.</p>

<p>When the light flashed out, its round circle showed
only a room twenty feet square in size, with bare
discolored walls. Plastering hung to broken lath,
so they knew that they were on the ground floor of
the deserted house, and not in the cellar. The floor
was worn, and the rough boards which half protected
the broken windows showed signs of having
been long in position. There was no furniture at
all in the place.</p>

<p>“Looks like we might rip off a board and walk
out,” Jule said, still speaking in a very low tone of
voice.</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever think we’re not watched!” Alex.
hastened to say. “I don’t know but I made a mistake
in showing this light.”</p>

<p>“There’s only one way to discover whether we
are watched or not,” said the other, “and that is to
try to get away. I’m going after that window.”</p>

<p>As Jule spoke he moved toward a window which
seemed to open on the bayou, as a gleam of water
could be seen through the cracks in the window-guard.
The instant his hand touched a crumbling
board a voice came out of the darkness.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t do that, boys!”</p>

<p>That was all. Jule stopped at the uncanny interruption
with a hand suspended in air, and Alex.
quickly flashed his light in the direction from which
the sound had come.</p>

<p>There was no one in sight. Rats or other creeping,
crawling, things seemed to be working in the
disreputable walls, for there was a continuous
scratching noise, but there were no other sounds.
Alex. shut off the light and sat down on the floor
again.</p>

<p>“I guess it is no use!” he said. “We’ll have to
surrender!”</p>

<p>“There will always be someone here to see that
you don’t get away!” said the voice. “If you make
any trouble, you won’t get anything to eat! Now,
be good!”</p>

<p>“You can keep me as gentle as a lamb by feeding
me right!” Alex. said, with a chuckle which was
rather forced. “Why don’t you show up?”</p>

<p>“You’ll see me soon enough,” the voice went on.
“In the meantime, don’t show that electric light
again, and if you have any weapons lay them on the
floor in this corner.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any,” lied Alex. “I brought the light
instead.”</p>

<p>As he spoke the boy nudged Jule, and he, understanding,
slid his revolver along the floor in the direction
of the voice. It struck against the wall with
a metallic thud.</p>

<p>“That’s right!” the voice in the darkness said.
“Now, you with the light, send it over here. I
might want to use it!”</p>

<p>Alex. slid his torch along the floor. In its progress
the button was pressed and a round illumination
sprang up on the wall. Almost in the center
of this they saw the white hair and beard of the old
man who had invited them into the room above!</p>

<p>The boys sat for a long time in serious thought
after that, well knowing that every word uttered
would be heard by their guardian. Alex. was more
than hopeful in his views of the situation.</p>

<p>“If these fellows were professionals,” he mused,
“they wouldn’t take any chances on us not having
more weapons and more lights. They would make
sure by searching us! I don’t believe they ever took
a prisoner before, or that they are very anxious
about keeping us. I guess we just butted in where
we’re not wanted, and they’ll let us go after a time.
Anyway, they’re easy!”</p>

<p>Directly loud noises were heard in the old house,
and the insecure walls shook under heavy burdens.
It seemed to the listening lads that huge boxes and
barrels were being transferred from one room to another.</p>

<p>There were excited voices, too, although no words
could be understood. It seemed to the two prisoners
that the old mansion was being deserted, and
their impression was that the thieves were removing
their plunder because their hiding-place had been
intruded upon. In that case, they thought, they
might soon be released.</p>

<p>After what seemed a whole day, food was pushed
into the room, and the boys ate heartily of the fresh
pork sausages, corn pones, and sweet potatoes given
them.</p>

<p>“You’re all right on the feed!” Alex. called back
in the direction of the corner where for an instant
the old man had been seen.</p>

<p>There was no answer, but, somehow, the boys
were convinced that there was some one there in the
room with them. It does not always require the
eyes, or the hands, or the ears, or the sense of smell,
to show one that others are close by.</p>

<p>There is a tingling of the nerves which warns of
the presence of hostile elements, and this it was
which showed the prisoners that they were still
under guard.</p>

<p>That was a long afternoon. For the most part
there were no sounds in the old house; still, now and
then, there came the jar of heavy burdens on the
floors, and the sharp and angry voices of men,
speaking in a tongue the boys did not understand.</p>

<p>When the cracks in the boards at the windows
began to darken, they knew that night was falling.
They thought of the comfortable cabin of the <i>Rambler</i>,
and of the companionship of the other boys
with spasms of anger and regret. As the darkness
became more complete outside, they arose and
walked up and down the floor of their little room.</p>

<p>“Say, Mister!” Alex. called out to their invisible
guard, directly, “how many acts are there in
this drama? When do the persecuted c-h-e-i-l-d-s
return to their agonized and heart-broken parents?”</p>

<p>“I’m as weary of it as you are!” was the remarkable
answer, still in that calm voice they had heard
before.</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you cut it out?” asked Jule.</p>

<p>“There are men in the party who advise that,”
was the significant answer. “They are at present
discussing your fate. Many declare that it is not
wise to permit you to leave the place! I’m sorry for
you, but you had no right to snoop in here!”</p>

<p>“Next time,” Alex. replied, “you hoist a piracy
flag, and we’ll keep away.”</p>

<p>“When will this strategy board you refer to make
a report?” asked Jule.</p>

<p>“I may receive orders at any moment,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>Silence followed. There were crunchings and
chatterings, in the walls where rodents were busy
making nests, but no sound of human action. In the
long wait the boys heard a low, inquisitive sniff!</p>

<p>Alex. drew Jule’s head over to him and whispered
in his ear:</p>

<p>“That’s Captain Joe, for a dollar and a half!”</p>

<p>“You’re on!” Jule responded. “I’ll be glad to
lose the bet at that, too!”</p>

<p>“I guess I know that inquisitive snort!” Alex.
went on. “Besides, I told you that the dog would
find some way to get to us!”</p>

<p>“Aw, Clay sent him!” declared Jule. “He
never found his way here alone.”</p>

<p>“The boys may be with him,” Alex. suggested, as
the sound came again. “I hope he won’t make
enough noise to disturb his nibs, over in the corner.
Good old dog!”</p>

<p>After a time they heard the patter of the dog’s
feet, and then the guard whistled softly, as if attempting
to make friends with whatever animal
was approaching.</p>

<p>“Come here, you foolish dog!” he said. “Why
don’t you come in out of the dark?”</p>

<p>The pat-pat of the dog’s soft feet came nearer,
and the guard spoke again:</p>

<p>“How the Old Harry did you get in here?” he
demanded. “Whose dog are you, anyway?”</p>

<p>The dog growled and there came a flash of light.
The guard, becoming afraid of this thing which had
found its way into a room supposed to be secure
from intrusion, and had switched on the electric.</p>

<p>The light revealed the two prisoners, grouped
together in the middle of the room, the old man,
standing with weapon extended and with staring
eyes, Captain Joe all ready for a spring, an open
window, and, lastly, the black face of Mose overlooking
the scene with eyes which seemed too large
for his head!</p>

<p>“Get him, Joe!” cried both boys in unison.</p>

<p>The light dropped as the dog leaped, and a revolver
clattered to the floor. Alex. had hold of the
dog in an instant, his other hand reaching for the
rolling flashlight.</p>

<p>“Don’t eat him up, Joe!” the boy said, tearing
the dog away from the fallen man. Captain Joe
fell away with a sullen growl.</p>

<p>“The brute has bitten my arm!” the old man
moaned.</p>

<p>“If you remain quiet,” Alex. said, “you won’t
have any more wounds to complain of. We’ll just
tie you up and get out! After we are gone some
one will come and let you out. What sort of a place
is this, anyway?”</p>

<p>The old man groaned and made no reply, so the
boys secured him and crept out of the window into
the darkness.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink07'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER VII—SEARCHING FOR THE <i>RAMBLER</i></a></h2>

<p>Case found the walking fairly good and reached
New Madrid shortly before noon, having started
about 8 o’clock. He procured the supplies for which
he had been sent and then sought the hotel and partook
of an excellent dinner.</p>

<p>“Now,” he thought, “shall I walk back to the
<i>Rambler</i> to-night, or shall I remain here and look
over the town?”</p>

<p>The question was soon decided, for all there was
of the town could be seen in a very short time. At
1 o’clock he started back to the motor boat. At 5
o’clock, just as the sun was setting, he came to the
bayou where the <i>Rambler</i> had been anchored.</p>

<p>There was no boat there. The night was falling
fast, and the bayou and the river were dimly seen
through a slight mist. The boy stood on the bank
of the bayou for a long time, studying the situation.</p>

<p>“There’s something wrong!” he decided. “The
motors could never have been forced into motion
with the parts missing! The boys would never
attempt to drift down, for the river is still filled with
drifting timbers and wrecks of houses and barns.</p>

<p>“And even if they should have decided to change
locations, notwithstanding the peril of the undertaking,
they would never have gone away without
leaving some one here to notify me of the new position!”</p>

<p>Passing on up the bank of the bayou, searching
for some sign in the darkness, Case finally came
upon the rowboat which Alex. and Jule had left
half concealed in a tangle of bushes in a little bay.
Before him, then, lay the old house, dim in the
night. He had heard the boys talk of visiting the
place, and at once concluded that they were there.</p>

<p>He looked over the structure for lights, but saw
none. Then he listened, catching in time the sounds
which the two boys had noted. He crouched down
in a patch of shrubbery and waited, listening for
some indication of the presence of his chums.</p>

<p>Directly he heard a shrill scream of fright, then
the bushes between his hiding-place and the house
were shaken violently, and a small figure darted out,
running at top speed and sending a scream into the
night at every jump!</p>

<p>“If that isn’t Mose,” Case thought, “then there
are two young negroes with most extraordinary
calliope possibilities! He runs like the Old Scratch
was after him, and has plenty of wind left to tell
how scared he is!” he added.</p>

<p>The small figure came smashing through the
shrubbery and finally landed in the thicket where
Case had secreted himself. Here he stumbled over
a trailing vine and fell forward on his face. Before
he could regain his feet Case had him by the arm.</p>

<p>“Mose!” he said. “Keep quiet! You’ll have
all the pirates in the state steering in this direction!
What is the matter?”</p>

<p>“Fo’ de Lawd’s sake leave dis nigger go!” wailed
Mose. “Dar’s ghostes in dat ol’ house, an’ dey’s
got de boys!”</p>

<p>“Are the boys in there?” demanded Case, giving
the frightened lad a gentle shake to bring him back
to his senses. “Where is the <i>Rambler</i>?”</p>

<p>“Ah don’ know!” gasped the little negro.
“Piruts don’ got de boat, an’ dem ghostes don’ ’pear
fo’ dis nigger!”</p>

<p>“If you don’t brace up and tell me what’s going
on,” Case declared, “I’ll throw you in the river.
Where are the boys?”</p>

<p>Before Mose could reply Captain Joe came dashing
through the bushes. He stopped by Case’s side
and lay down, trembling with excitement.</p>

<p>“If the dog could talk he would tell me what’s
going on,” Case said, reprovingly, to the negro.
“Where have you two been?”</p>

<p>Mose, evidently encouraged by the presence of the
dog, told haltingly of the attack on the <i>Rambler</i>
that morning, of his being thrown overboard, with
the dog, of his day of wandering, hungry and afraid,
about the old place, and of Captain Joe following
the tracks of the boys to the entrance to the house.</p>

<p>He said that he had lain in hiding, afraid to enter,
and had kept the dog quiet until it began to get dark,
when he had followed Captain Joe to a window from
which the sound of voices had issued. The dog had
leaped in, after he had pulled away the rotten board,
he said, and there he had seen Alex. and Jule, enveloped
in a ghostly light, with a white ghost struggling
with the dog!</p>

<p>The story was told with many sidelong glances at
the shadows which lay heavy on the landscape, for
a moon was now struggling through drifting banks
of clouds.</p>

<p>As the boy concluded his story, often delayed by
his fright, another commotion came from the
grounds nearer the old house. Lights flashed from
the windows and pistol shots were heard. Getting
one sniff of the acrid smell of powder, Mose leaped
to his feet and bounded away again. Captain Joe
lifted his nose, wrinkled it in derision, and rose to
meet two figures which were pounding down the
broken walk toward the bayou.</p>

<p>“Alex.! Jule!” called Case. “What’s doing?”</p>

<p>“Get a move on!” panted Alex. “Get to the
boat! Where did that little coon go?”</p>

<p>“He must be somewhere near the Rocky
Mountains by this time,” Case replied, falling into the
fast pace set by the other boys.</p>

<p>Very soon there were sounds of running feet behind
them, and the lads redoubled their efforts to
reach the boat before any one else could get to it.
Now and then a bullet cut the air close to their ears,
but they were not struck.</p>

<p>When they came to the edge of the bayou, Mose
had the boat out a rod from shore, and was doing
his best to row it across with one oar. The boys
did not wait for him to return to the bank, but
plunged into the water and waded and swam out,
Alex., the last one in, giving the craft a vigorous
shove as he crawled over the stern.</p>

<p>Without loss of a minute’s time Alex. and Case
took the oars and Jule seized the helm. They were
soon proceeding down the bayou at a rapid rate of
speed, but, fast as they were going, others were
moving faster along the bank.</p>

<p>“Come back or we’ll fill you full of air holes!”
shouted one of the pursuers.</p>

<p>The boys might have been forced to return to the
shore only for the fact that at that moment the
moon’s face was hidden by a mass of clouds. Taking
advantage of this, and sitting as low in the boat
as possible in order to avoid the bullets which were
coming in their direction, the boys made for the
mouth of the blind channel, and soon felt the push
of the current of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Before long the sounds of pursuit died out. The
old mansion, which stood on the point of land between
the river and the bayou, was now in darkness.
When the moon came out again it stood silent and
solitary in its neglected enclosure. It seemed to
the lads that everything that had taken place there
must be a dream!</p>

<p>“Now where?” Jule asked, as the boat passed a
bend and the house was no longer in sight. “Do we
know where we are going, any of us?”</p>

<p>“Where is the <i>Rambler</i>?” demanded Alex.
“We ought to have reached it long ago.”</p>

<p>Then, briefly, Case repeated the story told by
Mose of the capture of the motor boat. There was
silence for a moment, for the boys recognized the
seriousness of the situation.</p>

<p>There was little doubt in their minds that the
<i>Rambler</i> would be wrecked. No boat could drift
down that surging river, cluttered with driftwood
as it was, without meeting with disaster. And Clay
was on board, bound, and helpless in case the worst
happened!</p>

<p>“So that is how Mose and Captain Joe happened
to come to the rescue,” Alex. said. “The pirate
threw them off the <i>Rambler</i>! Well, he did a good
job when he did it, anyway! But how that coon
did run when we made for the window he had
opened!”</p>

<p>Mose, nestled in the bottom of the boat, stroking
Captain Joe’s wet head, grinned and declared that
the boys had looked like ghosts.</p>

<p>“It is a wonder the boy and the dog were not discovered
in the grounds!” Jule remarked. “I don’t
see how they came to keep out of sight!”</p>

<p>“I can tell you!” Case put in. “Mose was so
afraid that the pirates would come and get him that
he lay in the bushes with his face in the dead leaves!
Is that right, Mose?” he asked.</p>

<p>Mose had to admit that he was “sho’ scared
white,” and Captain Joe tried to explain, in perfectly
good dog talk, that he wasn’t frightened a bit, but
only lay by Mose to help keep his courage up!</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” Alex. said in a moment, “we’ve
got to study out some plan to get to Clay. We can’t
dodge the issue by talking of something else. What
shall we do?”</p>

<p>“I’m for going on down the river,” Alex. continued.
“The pirates can’t run the <i>Rambler</i> up
stream, and so we must find her if we keep on
going.”</p>

<p>“But she has nearly ten hours the start of us,”
urged Jule.</p>

<p>“I don’t think they will go far, as it is risky
drifting a boat down now. They will probably go
far enough to get out of the zone of pursuit and then
tie up, if the boat isn’t wrecked before that,” he
added, gravely.</p>

<p>“That’s good judgment!” Case declared.</p>

<p>“We’re lucky if we don’t get wrecked ourselves,”
Jule declared, swinging the boat about to avoid a
mass of wreckage which lay before her. “When
we come to the bend just ahead we’re likely to be
pushed over to the other shore. See how the current
sets that way? We’ll have to go some to beat
it!”</p>

<p>The current was indeed swift and treacherous. It
swept toward the east shore with almost resistless
force, and the rowboat was like an eggshell in its
grasp.</p>

<p>“Look out for the log ahead!” cried Jule, as the
boat swirled around.</p>

<p>But there was more than one log ahead. It
seemed that a whole drive of logs, or timbers, had
been caught by the flood and whirled down stream.
The boys backed water, and Jule did all he could to
keep out of the mass, but the current was remorseless.</p>

<p>The boat struck a great timber and the force of
the shock and the cracking sound which followed
told of an injury to the craft. Mose stood up in the
boat, for water was now coming in!</p>

<p>“This seems to be our good-luck night!” Case
grumbled, in a sarcastic tone, as the boat lurched
against a great log and came near tipping over.</p>

<p>“There’s a raft ahead, anyway!” shouted Jule.
“We can ride down on that!”</p>

<p>“Until it takes a notion to dump us into the
drink!” complained Case.</p>

<p>The boat filled fast, and Captain Joe mounted the
prow and looked longingly toward the bobbing timber
raft just ahead. From the raft he looked back
to the boys.</p>

<p>“I reckon the dog has more sense than we have!”
Alex. exclaimed. “We’ll have to take to the raft,
all right, so here goes.”</p>

<p>“Wait for a bit of light!” urged Case. “The
moon will be out in a second.”</p>

<p>In the darkness which followed the boys could
feel the water rising in the boat. The current was
pressing the craft down against the timber raft, and
the creaking of the hull proclaimed a badly wrecked
boat.</p>

<p>“Say,” Case called out, “one of you boys get out
a light. We’ve got to make a jump right soon.
This is some adventure! What?”</p>

<p>Jule reached for his electric, but Alex. caught his
arm.</p>

<p>“There’s a light on the Missouri bank,” he said,
“and it looks to me like the cabin windows of the
<i>Rambler</i> were sending it out. Lay low in the dark
and drift with the raft!”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink08'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER VIII—FACES AT THE WINDOW</a></h2>

<p>“Look here, Red,” the outlaw who had been
called Sam said, addressing the giant, as the <i>Rambler</i>
struck the half-submerged tree, “we’ve got up
against something hard!”</p>

<p>“We never should have put out into the river!”
retorted Red. “A few more bumps like that, and
to the fishes we go! Get a pole out, and see if you
can push away from that consarned tree. Then
we’ll soon get to shore.”</p>

<p>Sam went into the cabin, where Clay sat, side by
side with the bear cub, on a bunk.</p>

<p>“Where’s your river pole?” he demanded.
“You must have something of the kind!”</p>

<p>“There’s one in hooks at the side of the cabin,”
replied the boy. “If you’ll cut this cord I’ll help
you get out of the current.”</p>

<p>Sam leered savagely at the boy for a moment,
picked up the revolver which lay on the floor not far
away, put it into a pocket, and then severed the cord.</p>

<p>“Mind you,” he said, as Clay sprang for the pole,
“if you try any tricks on us we’ll chuck you to the
fish!”</p>

<p>Without paying much attention to the threat, Clay
grasped the pole and ran to the prow, which was now
entangled in a wilderness of branches springing from
the bole of the tree the boat had struck. The boy’s
strength was insufficient, and Red came to his assistance.
Both pried and pushed, but it seemed impossible
to back the boat against the sweep of the
current.</p>

<p>As if to make matters worse, a long timber lodged
against the stern and added its weight to that of the
motor boat and the running water. Sam stood looking
on with a cynical smile on his hard face.</p>

<p>“You never can do it,” he finally declared.
“We’ll have to let the boat drift down in company
with the tree. Just our luck to strike such a snag!”</p>

<p>“If that limb wasn’t in the way,” Red asserted,
“we could get the boat out. It binds on the side of
the cabin.”</p>

<p>Clay hastened into the cabin and soon returned to
the prow with an axe. Both men eyed him sharply
as he came forward with the keen-edged implement.</p>

<p>“You know what I told you!” Sam shouted,
stepping toward the boy.</p>

<p>“Let him alone!” commanded Red. “I reckon
the kid knows what he is about!”</p>

<p>“Now,” Clay explained, addressing the big fellow,
who seemed more inclined to be friendly than
his companion, “if you’ll stand ready with the pole,
I’ll get over on the trunk and cut that limb away.
Then we can edge over to the shore.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” sneered Sam. “We let you off on
the tree, and you go on down and call out the police
at the first landing. Not for your uncle!”</p>

<p>“Go on,” shouted Red, to Clay. “I’ll steady you
with the pole, and when the limb is off you give it
a poke and come on board. Will you do that?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” answered the boy. “I have no intention
of going off and leaving the <i>Rambler</i>! Hand
me the axe when I get down on the trunk, will
you?”</p>

<p>Without waiting for any further conversation,
which was difficult because of the roaring of the
river, Clay crept over the gunwale and landed on
the tree, which sank lower under his weight. Then
he reached for the axe, which Red promptly passed
to him.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t get down on that tree for a thousand
dollars!” cried Sam. “If he don’t time himself
to a second, he’ll get knocked into a cocked hat
by the boat when she swings loose! I’m not stuck
on taking any such chances.”</p>

<p>“That is some kid!” Red exclaimed, admiringly,
as Clay chopped away at the limb. “I wish we had
him with us!”</p>

<p>“You want to look out for him!” Sam cautioned.
“He may prove to be too much of a kid for both of
us, but I’ve got him covered, so if he tries to——”</p>

<p>The limb dropped away after a few strokes with
the axe, and the boat righted and swung against the
trunk. The swaying of the trunk upon which Clay
stood threw him into the water, but he clung to the
tree and tried to work back to the boat. Sam lifted
the pole to strike his unprotected head.</p>

<p>“May as well get rid of him now,” he declared,
with an ugly oath.</p>

<p>Red struck the would-be murderer a savage blow
in the face and reached down to assist the boy to the
deck. For a moment it seemed that both of them
must be drawn under the boat, but the big fellow’s
strength won, and Clay was hauled, dripping and
exhausted, up on deck. Sam eyed him malevolently
and snarled.</p>

<p>“It will come some time!”</p>

<p>Red pushed the boy toward the cabin, the look
on his face friendlier than ever.</p>

<p>“Go and get into dry clothes,” he said. “Never
mind what Sam says! He means all right, only he
don’t know how to express himself!”</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> now swung off toward the shore,
and Red and Sam were kept busy working wreckage
out of her course. They snarled at each other
as they worked, and Clay was in constant fear that
Sam would play some treacherous trick on the big
fellow in return for the blow he had received. The
marks of the short encounter were still on his face.</p>

<p>Much to his relief, the <i>Rambler</i> was edged into
calmer water next to the Missouri shore. He had
no idea at that time, even, that he would lose the
boat. He did not know what had become of his
chums, but he believed that in some way they would
be able to come to his rescue. They had never failed
him.</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> drifted down for some distance,
leaking a little but not seriously, and was finally
worked into a little bay where there was no current.</p>

<p>That was a long day for the boy. Several boats
passed up and down on the river, and relief parties
searching for flood victims were frequently seen, but
Red always announced that they were in no trouble
whatever when questioned.</p>

<p>Clay was not bound again, but was kept in the
cabin, with the door closed. He could hear calls
from passing boats, but did not dare make the situation
known.</p>

<p>During the day the outlaws devoured what cooked
food there was in the cabin and gave some to the
boy. Once Sam lay down for a short nap. Red
was not communicative, and refused to answer any
questions as to his intentions regarding the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>A fine mist came down as the night shut in, but
presently the moon came out, and the outlaws began
discussing the advisability of proceeding on down
the river.</p>

<p>“We can get to our landing,” Sam insisted.
“Once there, we can get into the bayou back of the
island, where no one will think of looking for us.
We must get the boat out of sight,” he went on,
“before reports of her capture spread along the
river. Besides, the boys will be waiting for us at
the shanty.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Red finally agreed. “I’m willing
to take my chance on being smashed flat by a tree or
floating barn.”</p>

<p>Clay listened to the talk with interest. Somehow
he began to recognize the voice of the big fellow!
Where had he heard it before? Then, like a flash,
the memory came to him! The man had talked
with him from the river at Cairo! There is where
he had heard the voice!</p>

<p>At that time the big fellow had been pleading for
the safety of a waif who had come on board the
<i>Rambler</i>! Both the man and the waif had disappeared
when the officers had come on board. Clay
wondered where the boy was, and why this outlaw
had taken an interest in him. The man appeared to
be kind, though his appearance and his modes of life
were against him. It was all a deep mystery to the
boy.</p>

<p>However, the giant’s defense of himself, when
Sam would have mistreated and, perhaps, murdered
him, led Clay to believe that he was not wholly
depraved. There might be some powerful motive for
his adopting the life of a river outlaw.</p>

<p>The boy resolved, at the first opportunity, to question
Red regarding the fate of the lad who had so
suddenly disappeared from the boat that night.
He now saw that the willingness of his companions
and himself to aid the waif had led to good results,
for it was this willingness which had undoubtedly
caused the giant to stand between him and injury or
even death. His little loaf of bread cast on the
waters had returned to good purpose!</p>

<p>Sam seized the pole, as soon as Red agreed to his
proposition to make their way down the river without
delay, and began working the <i>Rambler</i> out into
the current.</p>

<p>“Better wait until that mess of wreckage passes!”
Red advised, as a crush of floating timbers made its
appearance under the moonlight. “If we get into
that bunch we’ll never get out again. It will go by
in a few moments.”</p>

<p>Sam stood looking at the mass with a frown on
his sullen face. He was anxious to be away for
more reasons than one. The boat had undoubtedly
been reported seized long before this, and every
craft passing up or down would soon be looking for
her. His idea was that the lads who had left the
boat would soon return and report the disappearance.</p>

<p>He did not know, of course, that Case was at New
Madrid, or on the way there, when they had attacked
Clay, nor did he suspect that Alex. and Jule had
fallen into the hands of a band of bandits in every
way as desperate and unscrupulous as that to which
he belonged.</p>

<p>But, aside from the question of safety, there was
another matter he wished brought to a conclusion.
He had been assaulted by Red, and was raging for
revenge. Once in the company of his lawless fellows,
his revenge might be gained!</p>

<p>“There is some one on that wreckage,” the watchful
Sam finally declared. “I saw a movement there.
Good thing we are not near enough to be asked for
help.”</p>

<p>Red looked at the floating raft and shook his
head.</p>

<p>“There is a boat lodged against the mess,” he
said, “but there’s no one on board her, and there’s
no one on the raft, either.”</p>

<p>The light of the moon was now shut out by a
drive of clouds, and the two men waited for a clear
sky again. When the raft was revealed they saw a
white bulldog running up and down across the timbers!</p>

<p>“That’s the brute I pitched overboard up in the
bayou!” cried Sam. “I wish I had knocked him on
the head. Some of those boys are not far off.”</p>

<p>Red laughed at the idea of the boys being there,
But Clay, listening with every faculty awake, had a
different notion of the capabilities of his chums.</p>

<p>“If Captain Joe is there,” the boy mused, his
heart bounding with hope, “the boys are not far off!
Anyway, I’ll give them a chance to see the old boat
once more!” he continued, reaching out and turning
on the cabin lights.</p>

<p>Sam uttered a fierce oath as the lights flashed out
on the rushing water, and made for the cabin, but
Red caught him by the arm and faced him around.</p>

<p>“Look here!” he snarled, “if you go to making
trouble for that boy I’ll send your worthless hulk
bobbing down to the Gulf! The lights won’t hurt!
We don’t have to answer any calls for help that may
come. Now, edge her out into the current and leave
the boy to me. There’s no sense in beating up the
kid!”</p>

<p>With a word of warning to Clay, not unkindly
spoken, Red switched off the cabin lights, and then
went to assist Sam in getting the <i>Rambler</i> out into
the stream. Clay heard them saying that the raft
was, after all, empty of life except for the dog.</p>

<p>“The boat lodged against it seems to be broken,”
Red said, and Clay’s heart went into his throat again.
He feared that the boys had been caught in wreckage
and drowned. The presence of the dog
showed that they had been with the broken boat, he
thought.</p>

<p>Then, while the two men worked frantically in
front, Clay heard the window leading to the cabin
from the stern deck cautiously pushed aside, and
then the faces of Alex. and Case appeared at the
opening!</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink09'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER IX—RED DECLINES TO TALK</a></h2>

<p>In a moment the ray of moonlight slanting
through the west window of the cabin was cut off
by a floating cloud, and the faces of the two boys
passed out of view. Their voices, however, came to
Clay, enquiringly.</p>

<p>“Are you all right?” Alex. asked.</p>

<p>“Have you got any dry guns in there?” was
Case’s question.</p>

<p>Clay answered both questions in a whispered
affirmative and moved softly toward the window.
It was necessary that some definite plan of action
should be agreed upon, for the lads’ presence there
might be discovered at any time.</p>

<p>“Is Jule there?” whispered Clay.</p>

<p>“We’re all in this neighborhood!” snickered
Alex., “including Mose, Teddy and Captain Joe!
We came down the river in a busted boat and on a
poor raft! We should have passed the <i>Rambler</i>
only for the flash of lights in the cabin. What
next?”</p>

<p>“First,” Clay answered, “I’ll get the reserve
weapons. One of the outlaws has my gun, but the
others are in the lower drawer of the cupboard.
I’ve been trying to get at them for a long time, but
this is the first time, since I was set free of bonds,
that the men have been too busy to notice me.”</p>

<p>Clay crawled to the cupboard and secured three
revolvers, held as a reserve stock.</p>

<p>“Now,” he directed, “you boys get through the
window while the ruffians are busy and the moon is
out of business.”</p>

<p>As the boys wiggled their way through the small
opening, Teddy began uttering growls of joy and
welcome. He pranced about the cabin, too, in spite
of all Clay could do to restrain him, tipping over
chairs and rattling the dishes in a great pan on the
floor, where the pirates had left them after their
luncheon.</p>

<p>And then, as if to add to the perplexities of the
situation, the clouds which veiled the moon drifted
away, and a slant of light shone full on the little
stern deck, and on the figures grouped there. Case
and Jule pulled themselves through into the cabin,
but Alex. was left crouching on the outside. Clay
passed him a revolver, and started to close the window.</p>

<p>At that moment, attracted by the unusual commotion
on the inside, Sam lurched to the door and
looked through the glass panel. He saw Clay at the
window, and caught sight of a figure outside and
called out to Red, who was still busy at the prow,
trying to keep the boat out of a mass of wreckage
which was coming down faster than the boat was
going for the reason that it was farther out in the
current.</p>

<p>Almost before Red could turn around, before his
brain could grasp the significance of Sam’s warning
shout, Clay swung the door open and turned the
switch which operated the prow light. In an instant
the deck of the <i>Rambler</i> was as light as it had ever
been at noon. The cabin was still in darkness, save
for the light which came through the glass panel of
the door.</p>

<p>The hands of both outlaws swung to their hips as
the light flashed out, but did not bring forth the
weapons carried there. Instead, they came up
empty and were pushed out straight and held there.
It was Clay who had given the order to keep hands
out.</p>

<p>Clay advanced along the unsteady deck to Sam
and held his gun within an inch of his crooked nose,
at the same time calling to Case to come and relieve
the outlaw of his weapons.</p>

<p>Sam’s looks would have committed murder, if
savage eyes and revengeful frowns could have done
so, when the weapons were taken from him. Glancing
hastily at Red, Clay thought he saw an amused
smile lurking in the giant’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Now, Sam,” Clay said, “we’ve got to repair the
motors and get the <i>Rambler</i> out of this ruck, where
the leak can be repaired, so we’ve got no time to
waste guarding a skunk like you. You would have
murdered me if Red hadn’t interfered, but I’m going
to give you a chance for your life! Can you
swim?”</p>

<p>“Fo’ de Lawd’s sake!” grunted Mose, appearing
on the deck, wet and shivering from the river,
“dat’s de ’dentical question he done ask me!”</p>

<p>Captain Joe, who had come on board from the
raft with the negro, sniffed at the heels of the outlaw
and seemed to ask permission of Clay to take a
bite out of him. The cub pranced around the little
waif as if he had found a friend from whom he had
long been parted. Sam did not answer the question.
He glared at the weapons, at the exposed fangs of
the bulldog, and turned a scowling face to Red.</p>

<p>“These rascals seem to be friends of yours,” he
said. “I don’t hear anything about your being given
a chance to swim! Is this a frame-up?”</p>

<p>Red’s already flushed face darkened at the insulting
question, and he would have struck Sam only
that Case, whose gun was at his breast, motioned
him to desist.</p>

<p>“There’ll come a time!” growled Sam. “Me an’
you will have a settlement right soon after we get
shut of these imitation tramps. Understand that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, kiddo,” Red cut in, turning to Clay, “Sam
can swim. He’s great on giving exhibition stunts in
the water. He can do anything with water except
drink it.”</p>

<p>“Glad to know it!” Clay replied, “for I want to
see how far he can swim! Take a run-and-jump,
you toy pirate, and get overboard.”</p>

<p>“Fo’ de Lawd’s sake, dat’s what he said to
dis——”</p>

<p>Sam did not wait to hear the completion of the
sentence, for Captain Joe, sensing, doubtless, that
the outlaw was in bad with the party, advanced
upon him. The pirate sprang for a floating timber,
missed it, and went under. He came up in a second
and struck out for the shore through a comparatively
clear channel. The boys watched him until he
crawled out on a mud bank and then turned to Red.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked that individual, a smile on his
face. “What next?”</p>

<p>“First,” Clay said, “I want to thank you for
saving me from that ruffian, and then I want you to
sit down and wait until we get up the greatest dinner
that ever was served on the Mississippi. I’m
half starved, and I know that the boys are. Of
course, if you want to land right now, we’ll put you
ashore.”</p>

<p>“I reckon,” Red replied, with a slight tremble in
his gruff voice, “that I can’t do better than to stick
here for a time!”</p>

<p>“Well,” Clay went on, “the boys are wet and
cold, as well as hungry, and so I’ll have to do the
cooking. Will you come in the cabin and sit by me
while I do it?”</p>

<p>“Will I? I’m lucky not to be out there on the
shore with Sam!”</p>

<p>The two passed into the cabin, after the boys
had put on dry clothes and warmed themselves at the
coal stove, and Clay set about cooking a mammoth
steak which had been bought at Cairo and kept in
the tiny refrigerator. Then he boiled potatoes, and
made light biscuit, and the coffee he produced was a
hearty meal in itself! There were tinned beans, and
sardines, and salmon, and many other things when
the meal began, but when it was over the table was
bare of everything in the provision line!</p>

<p>In the joy and comfort of being full-fed, Mose,
Captain Joe, and Teddy rolled up in a common rug
on the floor, in a corner where they would not be in
the way, and went to sleep. Clay and Red went out
on deck while the others washed the dishes.</p>

<p>“Are you thinking of sticking about this section
all night?” asked the latter.</p>

<p>“Only for a short time,” Clay answered. “We’ll
fix the motors, directly, and go on down the river.
Why do you ask the question? Don’t you want to
stay here?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking,” Red observed, quite coolly,
“that, with the lights going, and the shore not far
away, Sam might be thinking of taking a shot or
two at the boys!”</p>

<p>“But he hasn’t any gun!” Clay exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes, he has,” Red returned. “He has a gun
that wasn’t found on him. He keeps it in a watertight
sack under his left arm. He’s used to taking
to the water!”</p>

<p>“And you think he will hang about the bank,
walking down from where he was put off, and try to
pick us off?” asked Clay. “How far are we now
from the mud bank he mounted?”</p>

<p>“Not more than a couple of miles,” was the reply.
“We are in water that shows only a trace of current
now, because there is a great headland just
below, and the flood has packed the curve full. He
probably has been able to keep up with the boat.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t going very fast!” laughed Clay, “for
it has been at least two hours since he left the boat.
The moon, which is in the first quarter, sets about
eleven, and it is hiding itself in the trees already!”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t advise sticking hereabouts,” insisted
Red. “I can say no more!”</p>

<p>“All right!” Clay replied. “We’ll fix the motors
and start on down. Here, Case,” he called out,
“did you bring the repairs?”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know!” was the answer, and
in a short time Clay was at work on the motive
power, which was not much out of repair and was
soon fixed.</p>

<p>“You know, of course,” Clay said to Red, as the
<i>Rambler</i>, under perfect control, started down stream
at a pace which kept the driftwood from lunging
against her stern, “that I recognize you as the man
who talked with me out of the river at Cairo?”</p>

<p>“I never suspected it!” was the slow reply.
“How do you know I’m the man?”</p>

<p>“Your voice!” was the reply. “It puzzled me
at first, though.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to trade voices with some river rascal!”
grinned Red.</p>

<p>“You spoke, that night, about a boy who had
come on board?” Clay said, tentatively.</p>

<p>“That was my business there,” Red replied, with
a slight frown.</p>

<p>“Where did the boy go that night? We never
saw him after the officers came on board. He must
have swum to the Missouri shore.”</p>

<p>“He did,” was the hesitating reply. “He made
it, too!”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he remain with us?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“He got scared! If I had kept away he might
have done so.”</p>

<p>“Is he your son?” was the next question Clay
asked.</p>

<p>Red looked the boy in the face steadily for a moment
and then asked:</p>

<p>“You don’t want to harm the lad, do you?”</p>

<p>“I want to help him,” was the reply. “He looked
so forlorn, and wet, and cold, and hungry, that I’ve
thought of him a lot since. Where is he now?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Red said, in a perplexed tone, “that is
what I can’t tell you.”</p>

<p>“Because you don’t know where he is?” demanded
Clay.</p>

<p>“No; not that. I know where he is, but I can’t
tell you.”</p>

<p>“Is the child implicated in any crime?” Clay
asked, looking sharply into the man’s flushed face.
“Is there any reason why he can’t go with us?”</p>

<p>“Why do you suggest crime in connection with
the kid?” demanded Red, a frown on his face.
“He may be associated with criminals, innocently,
and yet be worthy of all your confidence and esteem!”</p>

<p>They talked a long time about the boy, about the
events of the day, and about the future plans of the
<i>Rambler</i> boys. The boat made good progress during
the night while all save Clay and his strange
companion slept. With the first flush of dawn Red
asked to be put ashore, refusing to give any reason
for wanting to leave the boat.</p>

<p>“You’ve used me mighty white,” he said at parting,
“and there’ll come another day! Don’t you
ever forget that, lads! There’ll come another day!
And if you come across that waif again, just feed
him, and warm him, and clothe him, and pass him
on to wherever he wants to go. Thank you all!”
and he was gone!</p>

<p>“What do you think of that for a mystery?”
Clay asked as the man disappeared in a grove near
the landing. “We shall hear from Red again.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink10'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER X—MORE RIVER OUTLAWS</a></h2>

<p>“And I have a notion that we’ll run across that
waif again,” Case said. “I imagine that he is somewhere
down the river, and that Red will not be far
away when we come to him. Somehow, we bunt
into mysteries wherever we go!”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a hunch,” Alex. exclaimed, “that we
are headed for news of that warehouse robbery at
Rock Island! It seems to me too, that the boy had
something to do, with it, or is mixed up in it in some
way.”</p>

<p>“He looked pretty lean and shabby for a chap
who had been interested in a diamond robbery!”
Jule suggested. “Perhaps he’s not guilty—just suspected!”</p>

<p>The day was fine and the flood was running out.
The river showed less wreckage than had been seen
the day before, for the lowering water caused much
of it to land on headlands and sandbars. During
the forenoon the <i>Rambler</i>, which was still leaking
a trifle, passed several river shanties and houseboats,
tied up below half-submerged islands, where they
were protected from wreckage.</p>

<p>These houseboats are common all along the Ohio,
Cumberland, Tennessee and Mississippi rivers.
Fishermen and indolent river characters live in them
the year round. Some of the boats are of good size
and well built and furnished, while others are
merely shanties built on rafts of logs and other
spoils taken from the waters.</p>

<p>Many of the boats carry whole families, and go
sailing toward the Gulf with streamers of shirts and
petticoats blowing from clotheslines. Others carry
two or three men and numberless dogs. Those who
reside on the boats live principally on fish, and on
corn meal and pork purchased with the proceeds of
fish sales.</p>

<p>Shortly after dinner the boys were asked to come
on board a shanty boat navigated by two men and
numerous dogs, so the <i>Rambler</i> was run alongside
and Clay and Alex. went aboard, where they were
warmly welcomed by two Chicago young men who
were making the river trip in the way of a winter
vacation. Their quarters were crude but comfortable.
They had had a rough voyage because of the
flood, but declared that they were going down to the
Gulf if the raft held out.</p>

<p>Almost the first question Clay asked was about
the Rock Island robbery.</p>

<p>“So you have been overhauled by the officers, too,
have you?” laughed one of the young men, called
Ben by his chum. “We had a bit of that, also,
but the officers didn’t remain with us very long. It
doesn’t take a week to search our craft!”</p>

<p>“Are you sure they were officers?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, they were officers, all right. They
asked for a boy of about twelve, who, they declared,
had been seen down the river, and who is believed
to have been associated with the Rock Island robbers.
They also asked for a man of six feet and
over, with red hair.”</p>

<p>Clay looked at Alex. significantly and asked for
any news they might have of the robbery—any details
they might have learned.</p>

<p>“Oh, we got the story from a St. Louis newspaper
we begged of a steamer captain,” was the
reply. “It seems that the silks, furs, and diamonds
stolen were stored in the warehouse one day and
taken out by thieves that same night. A boy answering
to the description of the one the officers
asked for was seen about the premises during the
afternoon, and at one time he was observed in the
company of a giant of a man with red hair.</p>

<p>“It is the theory of the police that the thieves
captured the boy and forced him to enter through
a broken window and unfastened the door, à~la
Oliver Twist. They believe that if he can be caught
he will be able to identify the robbers if they are
caught. The red-headed man was seen in the city,
wandering about the streets, aimlessly, on the night
of the crime. It is not believed that he was interested
in the robbery personally. However, they
want him because he seemed to take a great interest
in the boy.”</p>

<p>“Have the officers found any of the stolen property?”
asked Alex.</p>

<p>“Not that we know of,” was the reply. “The
robbers got off handily, and it is believed they put
the goods on board some river boat and sent them
down toward New Orleans. Diamonds, silks and
furs can be hidden in a small space.”</p>

<p>The boys visited with the strangers for an hour
or more and then went on down the river, sailing a
very little faster than the shanty boat, which depended
entirely on the current, and which was
obliged to tie up at intervals to avoid wreckage.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a notion,” Alex. said, as the boys left
the shanty boat in the distance, “that the newspaper
story is the right one. That boy never took part in
that robbery of his own free will, though. I am
sure of it! And the man? That was Red he described,
eh?”</p>

<p>“It undoubtedly was,” Clay replied, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“That’s your bosom friend!” Alex. grinned.
“You let him escape!”</p>

<p>“What else could I do, under the
circumstances?” demanded Clay. “The fellow saved my
life! Sam would have murdered me only for
him!”</p>

<p>“Well, if he’s on the level, what’s he doing with
a man like Sam?” questioned Alex., still grinning.</p>

<p>“We shall have to leave that question to the
future,” was the short reply.</p>

<p>“You believe that Red had a hand in the robbery
at Rock Island?” persisted the boy.</p>

<p>“I don’t think anything about it! I’m waiting
for additional information!”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got a long way to go yet,” Case cut
in, “and we may meet with the red-headed man
again. We may meet him in some jail yet, if our
luck doesn’t change!”</p>

<p>“Speaking about jails,” Alex. questioned, “what
do you make of the old jail of a house Jule and I
were locked up in? What do you think they wanted
to hold us for?”</p>

<p>“Probably to keep you from spying on what was
going on there,” Clay suggested.</p>

<p>“But what was going on there?” asked Alex.
“That is what <i>we</i> didn’t find out!”</p>

<p>“Whatever it was,” Jule observed, “the people
interested in keeping it secret took long chances
when they left us in the dark room with only an old
man to guard us. And imagine them never knowing
that Mose and the dog were in the grounds!”</p>

<p>At mention of Mose Alex. burst into a roar of
laughter.</p>

<p>“I never saw a human face that showed real fear
until I saw Mose looking in at the broken window!”
he said, directly. “I have seen men and
women show fright, but never anything like that!
He thought he had come on a collection of ghosts!
I presume he thought we, Jule and I, were dead and
buried in the cellar, and that our spirits had come
forth to haunt the murderers! And he streaked it
away like a flash of light!”</p>

<p>“There’s probably nothing worse than the manufacture
of moonshine whisky going on in the old
house,” Case contributed. “Or the loot from the
warehouse may have been stored there,” he added.
“The boys heard heavy articles being moved,
though they may have been scared stiff and mistook
the footsteps of a mouse for the heavy noises!”</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll get in just such a predicament
some day!” growled Jule. “It wasn’t any fun,
sitting there in the dark! And I expected that crazy
old man to shoot us any moment! I believe he was
crazy! He acted as if he was!”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” exclaimed Case. “Keep on
talking, and I won’t have to wash a dish all the way
to the Gulf. I love to hear you get funny.”</p>

<p>“That will do for you!” cried Jule, gleefully.
“I see you washing the supper dishes right now!”</p>

<p>“I’d like to go back and investigate that old
house,” Alex. observed. “It would be great fun! I
believe it stood there when the cave-dwellers lived
along the Chickasaw bluffs, and that was before De
Soto discovered the river and was buried in its
depths.”</p>

<p>“I thought La Salle discovered the Mississippi,”
Case said, with a wink at Clay.</p>

<p>“He made a stab at navigating it from the Illinois
river down,” Alex. answered, seeing that Case was
prodding him in the desire of receiving information.
“But he gave the wrong course to the stream. The
real Mississippi turns at St. Louis and runs off toward
the Rocky Mountains.”</p>

<p>“Yes it does!” exclaimed Jule. “You’re in
need of mental rest, young man.”</p>

<p>“Certainly it does,” Alex. insisted. “The
longest stretch of water takes the river name,
doesn’t it? Well, the Missouri is about three
thousand miles long from the fountain-heads of the
Gallatin, Madison and Red Rock lakes to the junction
with the Mississippi, while from the junction to
headwaters the Mississippi is only about twelve
hundred miles long!”</p>

<p>“It does seem as if the longest river should
carry the name,” said Case. “In that event, this
would be the Missouri river!”</p>

<p>“Sure it would,” insisted Alex. “The river from
the Red Rock lakes to the Gulf is the longest river
in the world—eight hundred miles longer than the
Amazon, though not so wide! Some day the name
of the Missouri will become the Mississippi, or the
Mississippi will be called the Missouri!”</p>

<p>The boys argued over the proposition for a long
time, until it was time to get supper, and then Clay
and Alex. began watching for ducks, with which the
river swarms at times. While they secured three
fair-sized birds, Alex. caught fish, and insisted on
their being cooked with the ducks.</p>

<p>“I’ll never get enough to eat if I leave the menu
to you boys,” he declared, “and Mose feels about it
just as I do!” he added, pulling the little negro’s
ear.</p>

<p>“Ah sure do feel empty!” answered Mose, rolling
up his eyes.</p>

<p>The Mississippi is a tangle of channels and
islands above Memphis, and the boys decided to tie
up for the night on the down-stream side of one of
the little “tow-heads” which are so frequently seen
close to larger islands. These are formed by deposits
of sand and vegetable matter, but they increase
in size rapidly as soon as cotton-wood brush
takes possession of the new ground, assisting materially
in resisting the encroachments of the current.</p>

<p>The islands of the Mississippi are numerous and
uncertain as to location. They have all been formed
by the cutting of new channels across headlands.
The river itself winds like a very crooked snake
through the soft bottom lands of the south, and the
water is forever finding new and shorter ways to
reach the Gulf.</p>

<p>From the junction of the Ohio, there are one hundred
and twenty-five numbered islands from Cairo
to Bayou la Fourche, in Louisiana, and besides these
there are nearly as many more which bear the names
of the owners. Many of these islands are grown up
with impenetrable thickets or show only deserted
fields.</p>

<p>In proceeding down the great river the boys had
kept on only sufficient power to gain steerway, as
they were in no haste to reach the Gulf of Mexico,
which was their final destination on that trip. They
decided that day to travel nights no more.</p>

<p>After supper had been eaten the boys switched on
all the lights and sat out on deck. There was a brilliant
moon, but they preferred to let everybody in
that vicinity know that they were there—hence the
electric lights.</p>

<p>“If any one sneaks up on us now,” Alex. laughed,
“he’ll have to get to us by the under-water route!
And, even then, one of us would be apt to see him.
Captain Joe is losing his record as a watch dog, but
I guess Teddy can take his place.”</p>

<p>Captain Joe, as if he understood every word that
had been said, and resented the insinuation, walked
up to the prow and sat in a meditative mood, looking
over the small “tow-head” which sheltered the
boat from the current. He sat there motionless so
long that Alex. finally called attention to him.</p>

<p>“Ah knows what he’s done seein’!” exclaimed
Mose. “Dar’s a big fat coon watchin’ us from dat
mess ob bushes. Ah done seen him long time ago!”</p>

<p>An inspection of the spot pointed out showed half
a dozen evil-looking negroes watching the boat.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink11'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XI—FIRE-FACES ON THE ISLAND</a></h2>

<p>“What are they squatting there watching the
boat for?” queried Jule, as the prow light fell full
on the group of negroes on the island. “They don’t
look good to me!”</p>

<p>“If we keep away from them,” Case suggested,
“and don’t try to stare them out of countenance,
they’ll probably keep away from us. They do look
fierce, though!”</p>

<p>While the boys discussed the matter the negroes
moved away from the shore of the island, where
they were under the boat lights, and secreted themselves
behind a patch of willows which fringed the
“tow-head,” for the place where they were was
little else.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they have any idea of letting us
alone, if they can manage to get on board the
<i>Rambler</i>,” Clay declared. “I have often read that
lawless negroes and whites are alike alert for plunder
during flood seasons, and it is floating goods
those fellows are after, unless I am much mistaken.
We’ll have to keep a sharp watch to-night.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be wiser to drive them away?”
asked Alex., with one of his grins.</p>

<p>“We have no right to drive them away,” Case
suggested. “We may get into trouble if we try it.
I’ll watch half the night and not mind it at all.”</p>

<p>Alex. nudged Jule in the side and whispered in
his ear for a moment.</p>

<p>“Jule and I will watch the first half,” he then
said. “Perhaps they will go off home by midnight,
and Case won’t have to watch at all.”</p>

<p>“Alex.,” Clay exclaimed, “you’ve got some mischief
in your mind. Heretofore you’ve come out of
your scrapes with whole bones, but sometime you’ll
get into serious trouble if you don’t stop running out
nights. I strongly advise you to let those levee
negroes alone! You go to bed early, and I’ll watch
the boat!”</p>

<p>“Who’s got mischief in the mind?” grinned
Alex. “I guess I can stay up until midnight without
gettin’ into trouble! You see if I don’t make the
dandy watchman to-night! When it comes to keeping
guard, I’m the candy boy!”</p>

<p>“You usually manage to get into trouble when
you are left alone!” laughed Clay.</p>

<p>“If I can’t be good to-night,” grinned Alex.,
“I’ll be careful.”</p>

<p>Nothing more was seen of the negroes at that
time, although the boys were satisfied that they were
still on the island, as no boat had been seen to leave
it.</p>

<p>After a time Clay, Case and Mose went to bed,
leaving Alex., Jule, Captain Joe, and Teddy on
deck. The dog seemed particularly wide awake,
moving about as if he scented danger, while the cub
sat looking toward the island with twitching nostrils.</p>

<p>“Seems as if the dog and the cub know there’s
something coming off here to-night,” Jule remarked,
as Captain Joe put his paw on the gunwale and
sniffed the air. “Do you really think they have a
way of discovering approaching peril which human
beings have not? Captain Joe certainly looks as if
he saw something unpleasant coming.”</p>

<p>“I often think dogs have an instinct which warns
them of danger,” Alex. replied.</p>

<p>“Well,” Jule went on, “we’ll soon see what
comes of the signals of danger he is now handing
out to us! Whatever he sees or senses is on that
island.”</p>

<p>The boys watched for a long time, but there came
no sounds of life from the island.</p>

<p>“You’re like the dog,” Jule said to Alex., presently.
“You are getting ready for a break of some
sort! Suppose you loosen up and tell me what it
is?”</p>

<p>“You remember that night on the Amazon, when
we scared the life out of a couple of renegade
Englishmen and a native Indian?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“Sure I do!” was the reply. “That was the
funniest ever!”</p>

<p>“Well,” Alex. explained, “I’m goin’ to try something
like that on these negroes.”</p>

<p>“Better let ’em alone!” advised Jule. “They are
wise to tricks!”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” Alex. laughed. “I’ll have them
walking on their heads, and walking the water at
that. I wish I had a boat, so I wouldn’t have to
swim to the island!”</p>

<p>“We’ve lost a rowboat every trip!” Jule exclaimed.
“I wonder why we didn’t pick the one we
had off the raft and fix it up. It wasn’t badly
smashed.”</p>

<p>“We may find it yet,” Alex. said, hopefully.
“We have come down just a little faster than the
current, and so it is probably behind us. When it
comes down we’ll get it and make it as good as
new.”</p>

<p>“Yes, when we get it!” laughed Jule. “There’s
a thousand people along the island beaches and
mainland levees watching for boats! Just like these
negroes are watching for anything at all that seems
worth picking out of the water!”</p>

<p>“It won’t do any harm to keep a lookout for it,”
Alex. decided. “Now,” he added, turning out the
lights and throwing off his coat, “do you want to go
to the shore with me? If you will go I’ll show you a
race that will beat anything you ever saw.”</p>

<p>“And leave the boat alone?” demanded Jule.
“I should say not. I’ll remain here and see that
your retreat is properly covered. You’ll want some
one here to hold a gun on the negroes you seem determined
to stir up.”</p>

<p>“Now don’t get a grouch on,” pleaded Alex.
“I’m doing this purely in the interest of science! I
want to see how far the emancipation proclamation
has relieved the negroes of the south from the old-time
superstitions of the race! Not to put too fine
a point upon it, kid, I want to see what a good
healthy ghost will do to a lot of river thieves! Do
you get me?”</p>

<p>“Going to play ghost, are you,” laughed Jule.
“Then I’ll be a ghost, too!”</p>

<p>Alex. listened at the cabin door for a moment, but
heard no sounds indicating the lack of sleep on the
inside. Then he crept in, fumbled around in the
darkness until he found two old bathing suits and a
square package which smelled of sulphur.</p>

<p>“Now,” he explained to Jule, as he came out,
“we’ll put on these bathing suits, so as to have dry
clothes ready when we return from the island!
You take a part of the matches, for we may become
separated in the thicket. We won’t do the Mephisto
act until we get to the island, then rub the sulphur
on thick—on your hands and face.”</p>

<p>“I guess I know how!” Jule remonstrated.</p>

<p>The boys placed their clothing in two piles on the
deck and donned the bathing suits—much to the
wonder of Captain Joe, who wrinkled his nose and
looked suspiciously at the boys. His remarks on the
subject of bathing in a swift river in the night time
were not in favor of the experiment. However, he
crouched down by Alex.’s feet and expressed himself
as willing to share in the doubtful expedition.</p>

<p>“When we get into the willows,” Alex. explained,
“I’ll let out a yell which will put Mose’s efforts in
that direction away to the bad! Then you run at
them on the right and I’ll close in on the left, and
we’ll see a race that will put the Greek events out on
a blind siding with fires banked. When you are
ready, drop in and swim for the bunch of willows
straight ahead. Swim slow and don’t make any
noise.”</p>

<p>The boys left the dark deck of the <i>Rambler</i> and
entered the water. There was little current where
the boat lay, and they had no difficulty in making the
willows pointed out by the promoter of the midnight
excursion. The lights of Memphis made a faint
haze in the sky to the south. The wash of the river
drowned all individual noises. In the distance the
caving of a bank sent down a heavy sound.</p>

<p>Believing that they had left the boat without
awakening any of the sleepers and landed on the
island without attracting the attention of the
negroes, the boys crouched down in a thicket and
listened.</p>

<p>The moon, which would set about midnight, was
low down in the west, and gave a fitful light at rare
intervals. There was a heavy mass of thunderheads
in the sky, and few stars showed through. There
were no indications of a light or fire on the island.</p>

<p>The boys, however, were much mistaken in their
understanding of the situation. When they dropped
off the deck of the <i>Rambler</i>, Clay poked his head
out of the cabin and watched them as far as the
darkness would permit. Then he returned to the
cabin, put on a bathing suit and took a square box
from the cupboard.</p>

<p>The box contained the reserve weapons and flashlights
of the party and was waterproof. With this
in his hand, and leaving Captain Joe on guard, with
strict orders not to leave the deck, he entered the
water and swam toward the shore, turning away
from the bunch of willows where the two boys had
landed.</p>

<p>Of course he did not know that Alex. and Jule
had left the water there, but it seemed to him that
they would naturally select the nearest point as their
landing place. Once on shore he sat down to await
developments.</p>

<p>He was certain that Alex. and Jule had entered
upon a dangerous expedition. The river negroes of
the south are by no means as superstitious as is
generally believed, and Clay knew it. He doubted
if they would run far at sight of a face blazing with
sulphur. It was his opinion that the boys would be
the ones to start the race!</p>

<p>The negroes were sure to be armed, and they
might be drunk, in which case they would not be
likely to permit the outer spirits to bluff the inner
spirits! Besides, they might have valuable plunder
on the island, and some would be brave enough to
remain and fight for it.</p>

<p>Of course, if Clay had gravely asked the boys to
give over their proposed joy visit to the island, they
would undoubtedly have done so, but he did not
care to do that. His thought was that he ought not
to attempt to control the actions of he boys, as they
all stood equal on the trip, no one having authority
over the others.</p>

<p>Besides, if the truth must be told, Clay, himself,
was not averse to a little excitement! In addition,
he was anxious to know what was doing on the island,
and why the negroes were assembled there.</p>

<p>Another feature of the situation was that a
watcher on the beach saw all three forms in the
water as they left the boat! When the lads landed,
Alex. and Jule at the clump of willows and Clay farther
to the west, this watcher lost no time in
communicating with his fellows in their rough-and-ready
camp near the center of the little “tow-head.”</p>

<p>The noise made by the negroes in getting ready to
meet whatever attack might be made upon them
gave the location of their camp to Clay, and he
pressed as close to it as it was possible for him to do
without advancing into the open, where he might
have been seen during any moment of moonlight.</p>

<p>It was a chill night, and there was a wind blowing
from the west which seemed to cut into his bones,
but Clay sat down not far from the camp and
awaited the opening of the drama! He could hear
the campers moving about, but could not distinguish
the words spoken. The moon sank out of sight for
good before any movement was made.</p>

<p>Then Clay saw a figure fit to frighten the most
courageous leave the fringe of willows and advance
deliberately toward the center of the island.
He had hard work to make himself understand that
the thing he saw was only one of the boys. If the
very Old Scratch himself had set foot on the “tow-head”
he could not have presented a more sinister
appearance. Clay watched the advance of the figure
with bated breath.</p>

<p>In a second after the figure appeared, flaming of
face and pointing hands, with a great cross of fire on
what appeared to be a naked breast, a long, wavering
cry went up from the camp, and then there came
a rush of feet. Clay could not tell at first which way
the feet were going, but a moment convinced him
that they were putting a swift distance between the
camp and the devil-figure approaching.</p>

<p>When a second figure, marked like the first, appeared
the shrieks of alarm, the running of frightened
feet, were drowned by the commands of a bull-like
voice to stop the panic-stricken flight and use
revolver and knife!</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink12'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XII—HALF FULL OF DIAMONDS</a></h2>

<p>At that moment, notwithstanding the commotion
and the threats of coming trouble, Clay felt like
congratulating Alex. and Jule on the manner in
which they were carrying out their reckless plans.
More blood-curdling shrieks than now proceeded
from the throats of the boys he had never heard.</p>

<p>Knowing that defeat, perhaps death, would instantly
follow on the heels of retreat, Alex. and Jule
charged the camp, swinging their fire-coated arms
and uttering cries which it did not seem possible
could issue forth from human lips. There naturally
followed a swifter flight on the part of the negroes.</p>

<p>But three or four black men, less superstitious, or
having more at stake, than the others, stood their
ground, calling to their companions that it was a
white man’s trick, and that they should return and
ascertain by the use of steel and lead just how human
their visitors were. For a time the voices of
the courageous ones did not check the mad rush for
the river, but finally a group gathered on the beach
and engaged in conversation, which, of course, Clay
could not hear.</p>

<p>Alex. and Jule now “disappeared” in approved
“ghost” fashion—that is, they drew black cloths
over their faces and hands so that their flaming
make-up could no longer be seen. In fact, it was
now so dark, the moon having set, that even the
figures of the boys could not be seen when they
crouched on the ground. The negroes on the beach
were only visible because they formed quite a large
group and kept constantly in excited motion.</p>

<p>Clay wondered if the boys would now understand
that their trick had failed and make for the
<i>Rambler</i>. At the first rush the negroes had fled, but
they were now listening to arguments intended to
reassure them, and the ultimate result was not in
doubt.</p>

<p>Before long the black men would swarm back to
the camp, perhaps make a thorough search of the
entire “tow-head,” in which case the boys were
sure to be discovered, unless they made their way
back to the boat before the search began. Clay
placed himself between the camp and the boat and
waited, thinking that his reserve weapons might be
needed.</p>

<p>The information that he had seen figures leaving
the boat just before the advent of the “ghosts,” as
given by the watcher, had instant effect on the
negroes. They swarmed back toward the camp,
making a great many more threats than Clay
thought was necessary! Two familiar figures now
came dashing toward Clay, and he called out softly
to them to halt a moment. The figures developed
into two rather frightened boys as soon as they came
close to the watcher.</p>

<p>“Me for the boat!” panted Jule. “I reckon
these coons know a ghost when they see one—not!
Me for the feathers, too when I light! Come on,
Alex!”</p>

<p>“Go on and get aboard!” Alex. urged. “I want
to see Clay a moment.”</p>

<p>Jule darted away and was soon out of sight. Although
he had carefully made up as a disciple of
Old Nick, he was careful not to exhibit any of his
trade-marks as he moved towards the boat! Clay
and Alex. stood listening to the commotion for a
moment, and then the latter panted, taking Clay’s
arm as he did so, and drawing him back toward the
camp:</p>

<p>“When I got up there,” he said, “I stumbled over
some one lying on the ground! I felt about for a
minute and found pretty much rags! Then some
one told me to get off the island or I would be
murdered.”</p>

<p>“Go on!” Clay said excitedly. “We have no
time to lose if we are to investigate this matter.
Was the person you talked with a prisoner?”</p>

<p>“Sure he was. He asked me to cut the cords,
but I had no knife with me and so had to make an
effort to untie them. The captive talked while I was
at work on the knots, and who do you think it was.
Give you three guesses!”</p>

<p>“Hurry! Hurry! We have no time to lose, I tell
you, if the captive is in need of our assistance. Who
is it?”</p>

<p>“The kid who came on board the <i>Rambler</i> at
Cairo!” replied Alex.</p>

<p>“And you had to leave him there—tied?”</p>

<p>“What else could I do?” asked Alex. “I didn’t
have even a knife! This foolish bathing suit has no
pockets, so I brought no arms with me. What
could I do, when the coons were making a rush for
the camp?”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get that kid!” Clay cried.</p>

<p>“If they would only go away for a minute,” Alex.
declared, “I could get him and bring him to the
boat, ropes and all!”</p>

<p>A shot came from the <i>Rambler</i>, and, turning, the
boys saw that the craft was aglow with electric
lights! Instantly they crouched lower in the willows,
for the strong prow lamp cast a ray far over
on the “tow-head.”</p>

<p>Another shot came from the boat, and then the
negroes at the camp made a break for the beach,
passing within a rod of where the two boys lay concealed.</p>

<p>“Shall we take them in the rear?” asked Alex.
“They have attacked the boat.”</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot!” warned Clay. “Remember that
we had no right to molest them in the first place!
The boys on the boat are awake, or the lights
wouldn’t be on. They can protect themselves, I
reckon. I hope Jule is in a safe place!”</p>

<p>The lights were still on, but not a person could be
seen. Then more shots came, and Clay saw that the
boys were firing through the small port holes in the
gunwale, and that the negroes were contenting themselves
with firing volley after volley at the cabin
windows, which were now void of glass!</p>

<p>While the boys on shore watched with intense
anxiety, the motors of the <i>Rambler</i> were heard, and
then the boat began to drop down stream.</p>

<p>“I wonder if Jule got on board?” Alex. asked.</p>

<p>“If he met with no opposition on the way he
probably did,” was the reply. “At least we must
suppose that he is either on the boat or in hiding on
the island.”</p>

<p>“Come on, then!” shouted Alex. “We’ll make
a success of this excursion yet. We’ll take possession
of the camp. I want a confidential talk with
the prisoner!”</p>

<p>“You’ll be getting a confidential talk with a bullet
pretty soon, if you don’t pay more attention to
getting off!” Clay answered. “The boat has
dropped down, and the negroes will soon be back
here. It is another swim! What?”</p>

<p>Almost before Clay had done speaking Alex. was
off in the darkness. Clay could just see his figure
moving along the ground, so he followed on after
him, wondering what new trick the lad had in
mind. The light from the <i>Rambler</i> grew fainter
every instant. For some reason unknown to Clay,
the boat was being moved down stream a long way.</p>

<p>In a moment Clay saw Alex. bending over a figure
lying on the ground at the edge of a rude windbreak
of willow bushes, cut and woven together.</p>

<p>“Where’s the coon’s boat?” he asked, hurriedly.</p>

<p>Clay smiled happily. He had not thought of that!</p>

<p>“Off there on the east side,” replied the boy.
“Have you got a knife yet?”</p>

<p>For answer Alex. seized the lad by the feet and
called out to Clay:</p>

<p>“Catch him by the shoulders, and we’ll carry
him!”</p>

<p>Clay was not slow in following the suggestion,
and the boys soon had the captive between the
fringe of willows and the water. The boat was
there, a large, four-oared craft which was partly
filled with plunder taken from the river. The
negroes were evidently making a business of gathering
supplies from the flood. Just then Jule came
up, out of breath from a stumbling run in the dark.</p>

<p>The captive was placed on board, and then Clay
seized a pair of heavy oars.</p>

<p>“Take the helm,” he called to Alex., “and you
help with the oars, Jule,” he added.</p>

<p>Then the craft shot out into the current. When
she came around the corner of the little island,
where the light from the <i>Rambler</i> struck her a series
of frantic shouts came from the men huddled on
the south bank, and a few shots were fired, but, the
current running swiftly, they were soon out of
range.</p>

<p>“Let ’em swim,” chuckled Alex. “A bath will be
good for what ails them!”</p>

<p>“Alex.,” remarked Clay, panting with the heavy
work at the oars, “you deserve a Carnegie medal!”</p>

<p>“Sure!” chuckled the other. “I’m the Johnny-on-the-Spot
when it comes to prescribing healthful
stunts for the working classes! Where is that boat
going?” he added as the <i>Rambler</i> disappeared
around a distant bend in the stream.</p>

<p>“This is what comes of running off in the night
without telling the boys what we were up to!”
panted Jule. “This is some boat, when it comes to
weight.”</p>

<p>In ten minutes the lights of the <i>Rambler</i> were in
sight again, the rowboat having passed around the
bend. Then Clay took out a searchlight and began
making signals to those on board. Directly an
answering signal came from the boat, and then the
lights halted, turned, and came up stream.</p>

<p>“You’re a nice lot of watchmen!” Case called
out, as the two boats came close together. “We
thought you had caught a floater boat and drifted
down stream.”</p>

<p>“This,” grinned Alex., “is the only old and
original relief expedition. We have with us to-night
a brand snatched from the coons!”</p>

<p>“Hand down a knife!” called Clay. “This lad
is capable of climbing on board by his own self!
And swing around a little so as not to tip us over!”</p>

<p>With no little difficulty the boys were landed on
the deck of the <i>Rambler</i>. Case regarded the visitor
with a quizzical smile as he bent over him.</p>

<p>“Did you take a dive at Cairo,” he asked, “and
come up at Memphis?”</p>

<p>The boy answered only by a weary smile, and
Mose stood staring at him with widening eyes,
while Captain Joe sniffed suspiciously at his worn
garments. Teddy invited him to a boxing match!</p>

<p>“I’ll go you boys a dollar to an apple,” Case observed,
“that this kid is still empty! He looks it!
Anyway, I’ll go and get him something to eat!”</p>

<p>“And don’t forget the heroic rescuers!” Alex.
called out. “I haven’t had a thing to eat since supper!
Say, kid,” he went on, “what’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Chester Vinton,” was the reply, in a frightened
voice. “I’m running away.”</p>

<p>“You wasn’t running very fast when we found
you!” commented Alex. “How did you come to
mix with those wreckers?”</p>

<p>“I was on a raft,” was the answer, “and I was
hungry, and I saw them on the island, and asked
them for something to eat. They tied me up!”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you stay on board the boat at
Cairo?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“I was afraid,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Red is back up the river looking for you,” Jule
observed, still shivering from his exposure to the
cold water. “He took passage with us part of the
way down.”</p>

<p>“I should think he did!” chuckled Alex. “And
he was a first cabin passenger at that!”</p>

<p>“Well,” Clay decided, presently, “perhaps we’d
better feed this boy and put him to bed. He looks
as if he’d been up against something hard.”</p>

<p>The lad ate ravenously, and then began undressing.
Clay sat in the cabin with him. He was full
of wonderment at this second meeting with the boy,
and wanted to ask him a hundred questions, but
decided to wait until the lad was in better condition.</p>

<p>As the visitor threw his ragged clothes off a thud
on the floor told of something of considerable
weight in one of the pockets.</p>

<p>“Do you carry a gun, lad?” he asked, stooping
over to lift the trousers.</p>

<p>The boy bounded forward and snatched at the
trousers, but Clay was too quick for him. The
article which had made the noise on the floor was a
leather bag.</p>

<p>An investigation showed that it was half full of
diamonds of exceptional quality!</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink13'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XIII—A RIVER ROBBER IN A NEW ROLE</a></h2>

<p>With half a dozen stones of splendid value rolling
over the palm of his hand, Clay regarded the
boy accusingly.</p>

<p>“Where did you get the diamonds?” he asked.</p>

<p>The boy did not answer. Clay had expected confusion
and shame. Instead he met with anger and
reproach. Chester (“Chet” from that day forward)
shot forward like an arrow and tried to
wrest the bag from his hands. Clay put him back
tolerantly.</p>

<p>“Give them back to me!” Chet shouted so loudly
that the boys out on the deck entered the cabin and
stood in an astonished group about the two.</p>

<p>Clay, grasping the bag and the lose gems, held his
hands high above his head.</p>

<p>“Where did you get them?” he persisted.</p>

<p>“Give them back to me!” yelled Chet. “You’ve
been following me for this, have you? You’re all as
bad as the river thieves I’ve met up with! Give
them to me!”</p>

<p>“What do you think of the little one for a diamond
dip?” asked Alex., pointing at the flushed
face of the agitated boy. “He’s some clever!”</p>

<p>“I reckon he belongs with Red, the Robber, all
right!” Jule put in.</p>

<p>“He seems to be pretty well fixed!” laughed
Case. “Those gems are worth more than a hundred
thousand dollars! Did you swipe them from the
men who robbed the Rock Island warehouse, kid?”
he added.</p>

<p>Chet turned a flaming face toward this new accuser.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare call me a thief!” he shouted.
“The diamonds are mine! I never stole them.
Give them back to me, you—you—river pirates!”</p>

<p>“That’s good, coming from him!” grinned Alex.
“Come on, little one, and tell us who these stones
belong to.”</p>

<p>“I tell you they are mine!” Chet again insisted.
“I never stole them! You give them back to me!
If I had the strength I’d tear your heart out!”</p>

<p>“Of course!” laughed Clay. “Of course you’d
do something desperate if you had the strength!
But don’t trouble yourself about the diamonds! If
they belong to you, you shall have them. But we
don’t want to harbor a thief, you know!”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you’ll ever give them back to
me!” sobbed the boy. “I’ve brought them down the
river, all this way, to be robbed of them at last!”</p>

<p>In a spasm of grief the lad threw himself on the
cabin floor and burst into an uncontrollable fit of
weeping. The boys stood around for a moment,
looking rather sheepishly at each other, and then all
left the cabin but Clay.</p>

<p>“Come kid,” the latter said, lifting Chet from the
floor and holding him in his arms like a baby, “don’t
act like you’d lost your last friend! If you’re
honest, you’ve found friends instead of losing them.
You shall have the diamonds back, if you can show
that they belong to you. Brace up, now, and go on
to bed!”</p>

<p>Chet regarded Clay through wet eyes for a moment
and then slipped away to the bunk which had
been set aside for him. The frank inspection seemed
to have in a measure restored his equanimity. Clay
sat down by the side of the bunk, the diamonds in
his hands.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you tell me all about it?” he asked
of the boy. “Why not settle the whole matter right
here, and so have done with it? Where did you get
them?”</p>

<p>“I’ve promised not to tell,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“You are not making a very good beginning,”
Clay admonished.</p>

<p>Chet made no reply whatever, but turned his face
away. Clay went on, patiently:</p>

<p>“Where is your home?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got any home,” was the reply. “I
never had one.”</p>

<p>“But you must belong somewhere,” Clay insisted.
“Where did you live last?”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to tell you anything at all,” Chet
replied, “until I see the man that made me promise
to keep silent, and until he gives me leave to talk
with you.”</p>

<p>“Is the man you mention Red, the riverman?”
asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I just tell you that I wasn’t going to
talk?” demanded the boy.</p>

<p>“All right,” Clay responded. “Take all the time
you want! In the meantime, I’ll keep the diamonds.
Will you promise to remain on the boat?”</p>

<p>“If I had the diamonds, I’d quit you right now!”
said the boy, savagely. “I may as well tell you the
truth. If you keep the diamonds, I’ll stay until I get
them, but I’ll find them and take them with me if I
can. You just mind that!”</p>

<p>“You’re a frank little chap, anyway!” laughed
Clay.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t brought up to tell lies!” was the astonishing
reply.</p>

<p>“Who brought you up?” asked Clay. “You
just said you never had any home!”</p>

<p>“Never did!” was the reply. “Say, you won’t
blame me if I find where you put the diamonds and
run off with them, will you?” he added, quite
gravely.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how I can blame you, after such fair
warning,” laughed Clay.</p>

<p>“And you won’t help any one to find me?” persisted
the little fellow.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Clay, “if you are sharp enough
to get the diamonds away from me, I’ll never let on
that I ever saw or heard of you. Is that satisfactory
to you?”</p>

<p>“Will you shake hands on that?” asked Chet,
sitting up on the bunk.</p>

<p>“Gladly! Now, go to sleep and wake up in a
more communicative mood to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stick to what I said!” Chet answered, and
Clay left him alone in the cabin. When he reached
the deck he was at once surrounded by the boys, all
eager to know the outcome of the conference. Clay
told them of what had taken place.</p>

<p>“He’s a nervy little chap!” Clay concluded, “and
I like him very much already.”</p>

<p>“You bet he’s all right, that kid!” Alex. said.
“If he wasn’t, he wouldn’t have told you that he
would get the gems the first time he got a chance.
Besides, see how he is keeping the promise made to
some other fellow! Where are you going to keep the
diamonds, Clay?” the boy continued. “Don’t you
ever think the kid won’t try hard to find them! I
hope he won’t feel called upon to cut all our throats
in order to obtain possession of them! I believe he
would do it if he thought it necessary!”</p>

<p>“Well,” Clay answered, speaking in a low tone
and looking in through the glass panel of the cabin
door to see that Chet was still in his bunk, “I think
I’ll go ashore at Memphis, for supplies, you know,
and put the gems in a deposit box at one of the
banks.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fine idea!” cried Case. “He’ll never
get them there!”</p>

<p>“But you want to look out that you’re not pinched
in the bank,” Alex. advised. “That warehouse robbery
is making some noise, and if a boy from a river
boat is seen to have diamonds, it is the jail house for
yours!”</p>

<p>“If you put them in a bank deposit box,” Jule observed,
“you’d better do them up so as to look like
a package of papers—bonds, or stocks, or something
like that.”</p>

<p>“That is a good idea, too!” Clay exclaimed.
“I’ll do it!”</p>

<p>“I’d give a lot to know more about the boy and
the diamonds,” Clay mused, as the boys began getting
breakfast.</p>

<p>They had talked so long, after reaching the boat,
that they had not before realized that it was most
morning, and now there was a flush in the east which
told of sunrise.</p>

<p>When Clay went back into the cabin to see about
the fire, he found Chet crouching on the floor just
back of the door. He yawned as Clay entered the
apartment.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” asked Clay, in
amazement.</p>

<p>“Guess I’m trying to find my way to the door!”
was the half-smiling reply. “I didn’t seem to know
where I was when I woke up!”</p>

<p>Clay accepted the excuse, and went on with his
preparation of breakfast. However, he doubted
what the boy had said. Notwithstanding the previous
good impression he had formed of the waif, he
wondered if the lad had not crept out of bed and
stationed himself by the door in order to hear what
was said about the disposition of the gems.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to be more careful,” Clay thought.
“That boy is a clever one!”</p>

<p>After breakfast the waif was rigged out with a
suit of Alex.’s clothes. In the new attire he seemed
to be a different boy from the one taken from the
camp.</p>

<p>The boys did not accept as the truth all he said
about himself, though that was not much. When he
declared that he had never had any home, they
commented on the fact that his speech and manners
were those of a boy who had been given a fair
education.</p>

<p>Chet at once took to the pets of the boat, Mose,
Captain Joe, and Teddy, the bear cub, and they
immediately recognized him as a member of the
family.</p>

<p>While he was playing with the cub on the prow,
Clay made an oblong package of the diamonds, scattering
them in between sheets of paper, and marked
them “Bonds.” The bag in which they had been
found was half filled with burrs, and small bits of a
broken dish and tied tight. It resembled the bag as
it had stood before any change had been made when
Clay had finished with it.</p>

<p>This bag Clay resolved to keep in his pocket until
he could place it under the eyes of the boy who
claimed it, the idea being to see if he really would
snatch the supposed prize and take to the river
again. Clay hoped that he would not, for all liked
the little fellow. That afternoon they ran down to
a Memphis pier and Clay went ashore with the
gems.</p>

<p>He was in time to secure a deposit box at a bank
and stow the diamonds away. The cashier with
whom he did business asked questions regarding his
age and permanent residence, and seemed satisfied
with his answers. He was, indeed, especially interested
in Clay’s description of the <i>Rambler</i> and the
voyages the boys had made in her, and asked permission
to visit the party that evening if he found time.</p>

<p>Clay gladly gave the required permission, ordered
supplies sent to the pier, and then started out for a
look at the beautiful city. Almost at the entrance
to the bank he met Alex., who had the flushed appearance
of a boy who had been walking pretty fast.</p>

<p>The two walked together for a block without
speaking, save for the initial greeting, and then
Alex. proposed that they go to a restaurant and have
a “steak about as big as a parlor rug,” as he expressed
it. Clay agreed, but laughed at the notion.</p>

<p>“Why not take it on board?” he asked. “We
can cook it much better than any city chef,” he
added.</p>

<p>“Well,” Alex. replied, “I saw a neat little restaurant
back here, not far from the river front, and I
thought I’d like to go there and have a feed.”</p>

<p>So the two turned into the restaurant, when they
came to it, and took a small table at a rear corner of
the room. It being late for dinner and early for
supper, there were few in the place.</p>

<p>One party, at the front of the room, at once attracted
Clay’s attention. There were three men in
the party, one young, smiling and flashily dressed;
one old, grizzled and clad in a well-worn business
suit; and another dressed expensively and with great
care. This man had a surprising growth of red
hair which showed evidences of great care. His
face was smooth-shaven, and had the appearance of
having recently been divested of a beard, the flesh
showing soft and white, as if not long exposed to
the weather.</p>

<p>When this man arose to pay the check and laid a
hand on the back of a chair, Clay noticed that the
hand was very large and finely kept. The man was
something over six feet in height! Clay gave Alex.
a kick under the table and directed his gaze to the
large man, then passing over to the cashier’s window.</p>

<p>“Take a good look at that man,” he whispered.
“Ever see him before?”</p>

<p>“I saw him when I passed,” was the reply, “and
brought you here. That’s Red, the Robber.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink14'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XIV—ALEX. BREAKS FURNITURE</a></h2>

<p>“Unless Red, the Robber, has a twin who is an
exact duplicate of himself,” Clay whispered, “that
is just who it is!”</p>

<p>“When I passed here,” Alex. explained, “the
three were just sitting down to dinner, and I knew
that I could get you back here in time to see Red,
the Robber, before he could finish the big steak he
had just tackled. There he is! Now what?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem possible that that finely-dressed,
well-groomed man is really the one who talked with
us out on the river at Cairo, and who afterwards
captured the <i>Rambler</i> by holding a gun about the
size of a cannon on me,” Clay declared.</p>

<p>“And the man who bespoke kind treatment for
Chet, the waif,” Alex. went on. “I guess we’re
both seeing things not present to the senses! There
ain’t no such man!”</p>

<p>“It can’t be!” Clay tried to convince himself.
“It can’t be the same man!”</p>

<p>Yet he knew deep down in his heart that it was the
same man! If there had been any doubt of the
complete identification at the start, there was none
when the man spoke to the cashier in the full, deep
voice which Clay knew that he had heard while he
was tied up in the cabin of the <i>Rambler</i>!</p>

<p>“I have heard that river thieves sometimes make
up to look like bankers and high-up politicians,”
Alex. whispered.</p>

<p>“And I have heard that bankers and high-up
politicians occasionally assume the disguises of river
characters for some purpose of their own,” Clay returned.</p>

<p>“Do they mix with murderers and steal motor
boats when they do that?” asked Alex., with a provoking
snicker. “’Cause if they do, this may be
one of the high-ups!”</p>

<p>“He must recognize us,” Clay went on. “Watch
and see if you catch in him any signs of joy at the
meeting!”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t yet shown that he knows we are in the
room,” Alex. replied.</p>

<p>“There’s one way to find out who he is,” Clay
suggested. “When he leaves here, you follow him
until he enters some house or office and ask questions
about him after he goes on. I’ll do the same
here—that is, I’ll see what the cashier knows about
him.”</p>

<p>Alex., glad of an opportunity of showing what he
could accomplish as a detective, readily agreed to
this arrangement, and, the man leaving the restaurant
at the moment, Alex. darted away after him,
leaving Clay to question the cashier.</p>

<p>The big man, still in the company of his two companions,
walked briskly toward the river front, after
leaving the restaurant, and finally came to a stop at
a pier some distance down the stream from that at
which the motor boat lay. Alex. watched the three
men shake hands gravely and part, the one he believed
to be Red going on board a small steamer
which lay close by with smoke pouring from her
stacks.</p>

<p>“Now,” thought the boy, “shall I give it up, or
shall I sneak on board the boat and see what I can
learn of this man who poses as a river pirate one
day and as a gentleman of great respectability the
next?”</p>

<p>Alex.’s horse sense told him to wait about the
pier until some one came off the boat and engage
that person in conversation in an effort to learn the
identity of the man he was following, but his natural
love of adventure told him to make his way on board
and learn there what he could, not only of the man,
but of the steamer and its destination and cargo.</p>

<p>The spirit of adventure won, and Alex., waiting
until there was no one in sight on the freight deck,
ventured on board. There was still no one in sight
when he reached the staircase leading to the cabin,
and he proceeded to climb up, listening between steps
for indications of human life.</p>

<p>He found the indications he sought with a vengeance
at the head of the stairs. As he stepped up
a husky negro seized him by the collar and dragged
him toward the prow. Alex. kicked and struggled
to no purpose. The negro was too strong for him.
All the time he was carrying him along, almost as
he would have carried a kitten, the negro kept up a
running fire of comment.</p>

<p>The boy gathered from this comment that he was
regarded as a sneak thief, and tried more than once
to explain, but the negro kept on talking to himself
and paid no attention to the words of his prisoner.
Alex. administered a sturdy kick and gave it up.</p>

<p>Presently a door was opened at the very front end
of the cabin and the boy was thrust into a small
stateroom. The force of his entrance sent him
against a berth and he crawled up and lay down to
think things over. He heard the door behind him
locked.</p>

<p>“This is a pretty kettle of fish!” grunted the boy,
as he looked about the room.</p>

<p>It was just an ordinary stateroom, with one bunk,
a dresser, and a chair. The window looking out on
deck was covered by green slat-blinds, and ornamental
metal-work covered the glass panel of the
door opening into the cabin.</p>

<p>After taking in the room in all its details, Alex.
arose and tried to open the green blinds so as to get
a look outside. To his surprise he found that they
would not open. They were of steel, and were there
to protect the window! The room was as stoutly
guarded as a prison cell!</p>

<p>“Red, the Robber, seems to have use for a cell,”
the boy thought, “that is, if this is his boat! I wonder
what he thinks he’s going to do with me?”</p>

<p>Alex. had now no doubt that Red had recognized
Clay and himself at the restaurant. He wondered if
Clay, too, had been trapped! He could not make
up his mind as to whether the man was a robber or a
gentleman of business standing, but he knew that
he was in a most undesirable situation.</p>

<p>Then he began to wonder if Red knew that he was
on board! The man had given no intimation that he
had knowledge of being followed. He, Alex., had
sneaked on board, like a veritable wharf rat, and
the husky negro had been fully justified in taking
him into custody! Still, the negro should have listened
to his explanations and given him a chance to
prove his innocence.</p>

<p>This last view of the case was much more to the
liking of the boy than the previous one, for Red had
shown a friendly spirit while on board the <i>Rambler</i>,
and might now set him free as soon as informed of
his capture. Clay had permitted Red his freedom
under much more trying conditions!</p>

<p>“If he’s a river thief,” Alex. concluded, “he’ll
keep me here until he is sure I can’t injure him by
telling of his raid on the motor boat, but if he is on
the level—if he was, for some purpose of his own,
masquerading while in company with Sam—he will
release me as soon as he knows I am here—for
Clay’s sake, if not for my own!”</p>

<p>This was a rather comforting conclusion, so the
boy began beating with all his might on the panels
of the door. He pounded away for some moments
without hearing the least response, and then sat
down to rest.</p>

<p>While he sat there on the berth, panting from his
unnoticed exertions, the boat quivered in all its timbers,
the noise of escaping steam reached his ears,
and then he knew that the steamer was under way.
This was the worst thing that could happen to the
boy, and he knew it.</p>

<p>The steamer might go to Cuba, or to the upper
reaches of the Missouri or the Mississippi, separating
him from his chums for weeks. If Red really
was a robber, he would not take the chance of releasing
him, for that would give him an opportunity
to warn those on board the <i>Rambler</i>, as well as to
report to the police the illegal seizure of the motor
boat!</p>

<p>“I’m going to find out about this!” Alex. declared,
springing off the berth. “I’m going to do
an English suffragette stunt and smash windows!”</p>

<p>As his whole mind was set on making a noise so
as to attract the attention of the man he had followed
on board, the boy was by no means conservative in
his next move.</p>

<p>First he took the light-framed chair which stood
by the berth and smashed it against the fancy metal
work which protected the glass panel. The chair
went to pieces without touching the glass, so Alex.
took up a slender leg and, poking it through in between
the metal work, punched out the pane.</p>

<p>It fell back into the cabin with a rattle, and then
Alex., putting his face close to the opening, let out a
yell which would have done credit to an Apache Indian
on the warpath! In the meantime the steamer
was backing out into the current.</p>

<p>“I guess that will let ’em know they have a
cabin passenger!” Alex. grunted, as he began tossing
the fragments of the chair out on the cabin
floor.</p>

<p>The boy was just considering the firing of his
automatic, which had not been taken from him by
the negro, when a heavy voice near at hand broke
into a hearty laugh, and the face of the red-headed
man appeared before the opening, half-shielded by an
arm, for the boy was still looking for things to throw
through.</p>

<p>“What seems to be the difficulty?” the man
asked, and Alex. thought he saw a twinkle of humor
in the blue eyes fixed upon him.</p>

<p>“No difficulty at all,” Alex. answered, with a
touch of irony in his tone. “I’m just doing this for
exercise, and to make business for boat builders!”</p>

<p>“Of course,” laughed the man, “you wouldn’t
come out if I should unlock the door?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” Alex. replied. “I’ve got a
good deal of work to do in here yet, and I might
bring back an axe to help out.”</p>

<p>“You’ll find that the berth is of steel,” the red-headed
man said. “You can’t chop that up. How
long will it take you to finish the dresser? I might
come back and let you out as soon as you have got
through with that!”</p>

<p>“All right!” grinned the boy, “anything to
oblige,” and he went at the dresser with the leg of a
chair!</p>

<p>The giant unlocked the door, stepped inside, and,
taking Alex. by the ear, marched him out of the
wrecked room. Once in the cabin he let go of the
ear and walked toward the stern with a hand on the
boy’s arm.</p>

<p>“You wasn’t so giddy the last time I saw you!”
declared the boy.</p>

<p>The man laughed, opened the door of a large
stateroom toward the stern, pushed the boy inside,
and stepped in after him. This was a handsome
room, elaborately furnished. Alex. dropped into a
chair and looked about.</p>

<p>The steamer now seemed to be making fast time
down the river, and Alex. looked out of a window in
the hope of seeing the location of the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“Say,” he finally asked, wrinkling his freckled
nose at the man, “what is the answer to this? I
give it up!”</p>

<p>“What was it you boys put in the deposit box at
the bank?” asked the man.</p>

<p>“I didn’t put anything in; I didn’t go to any
bank.”</p>

<p>“But your chum did. You met him at the bank
entrance, and brought him back to look at me!
You know what he put in the vault box. What was
it?”</p>

<p>“It was a long package marked bonds,” was the
boy’s reply.</p>

<p>“But did the package contain bonds?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I never saw the inside of it,” answered
Alex., wondering if this man had followed
all their movements since being allowed to leave the
<i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the lad you call Clay will tell,” smiled
the giant. “Or the boys on the <i>Rambler</i> may give
the information I seek—when you both fail to return
to-night.”</p>

<p>“So you’ve got Clay, too, have you?” shouted
Alex., and he make a rush for the door!</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink15'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XV—THE LEATHER BAG MISSING</a></h2>

<p>When Clay went to the cashier’s desk to pay the
check for the meals the two boys had eaten, also
with a view of finding out what was known there of
the red-headed man, he asked the first question
which came into his mind.</p>

<p>“Is that the sheriff—the tall man with the red
hair?”</p>

<p>The cashier eyed the boy keenly for a moment
and then answered the question by asking one, as
many who wait on the public have a habit of doing.</p>

<p>“Why? Do you want to see the sheriff?” he
asked, suspiciously.</p>

<p>Clay was provoked, but tried not to show it as he
replied,</p>

<p>“I thought I knew the man, that’s all. Perhaps
I was mistaken, for he would have recognized me,
I’m certain, if he had ever seen me before.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s not the sheriff,” the cashier replied,
more civilly; “I don’t know who he is. He came
in here this forenoon, for the first time, with those
two men, and he has been in here twice since. There
are others with him, too, for people kept coming
in and making reports of some kind to him. One
made a sign to him, through the glass, while you
were eating. He may be a crook, for all I know.”</p>

<p>Clay thanked the cashier and went away, turning
in the direction of the river front immediately. At
the next corner he came face to face with the
cashier of the bank where he had secured the deposit
box. The banker extended a hand in greeting.</p>

<p>“I was just wishing,” he said, “that I could run
across you this afternoon. I have a little spare time,
and I’d like to look over that wonderful boat of
yours. Not long ago I saw a full-page description
of your river trips in a Chicago newspaper.”</p>

<p>“Come along, then,” Clay replied. “You’ll have
a good chance to see it by daylight if you go now.
It isn’t very much of a boat, but we’re proud of
it. It is just an ordinary motor boat, with electrical
attachments which provide for lighting and cooking.
There’s also a little refrigerator, cooled by
water, and a container for holding electricity in
storage, so we have plenty of light when the boat is
not running. But come along and take a look at
it.”</p>

<p>As the two walked arm-in-arm down the street
two men fell in behind them, moving as they moved,
fast or slow, and stopping whenever the cashier
drew up to explain some city feature to the boy.
After a couple of blocks of this work, the two
walked faster and, coming in advance of the two
they had followed, turned about and greeted the
cashier warmly. They were promptly introduced
to Clay as Hilton and Carney.</p>

<p>“We’re just going to the river to look over the
<i>Rambler</i>, the famous motor boat we have talked so
much about,” Benson, the cashier said. “If Mr.
Emmett, here, has no objections, I’d like to have
you go along with us.”</p>

<p>“No objections whatever,” Clay responded.
“There isn’t much to see, but such as it is you are
welcome to have a look.”</p>

<p>Clay did not observe the significant look which
passed from the cashier to the two men, as they
walked along toward the boat. They soon reached
the pier and went aboard the <i>Rambler</i>, finding Case,
Chet, Jule and Mose there. The bear cub attracted
a great deal of attention, and Chet seemed to take
special interest in the doings of the party.</p>

<p>The three men did not hurry themselves at all,
but took their time about everything. They inspected
the bunks and the cupboard, and even looked
into the storage places under the decks and the cabin
floor.</p>

<p>Clay was with them most of the time, but now
and then they halted and conversed together in low
tones, so, of course, the boy dropped away from the
group. He considered this a strange proceeding on
the part of the guests, but said nothing.</p>

<p>Finally they asked Clay all sorts of questions
about their progress down the river, when they left
Rock Island, when they touched at St. Louis, and
when they reached Cairo. The boy, though wondering,
answered the rather personal questions
frankly.</p>

<p>It was almost dark when the visitors left the boat.
Their last visit had been made to the cabin, to inspect
the electric stove, and they passed the boys on
the prow as they went ashore. For a time after their
departure the boys discussed the unusual conduct of
the visitors, and then Chet and Clay went in to prepare
supper.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of a momentary absence of
Chet from the cabin, Clay looked in the hiding-place
where he had left the leather bag in which the diamonds
had been brought on shore. The bag was
gone! Clay hastened out on deck to meet two astonished
boys.</p>

<p>“Say,” Case said, “what’s come over Chet? He
came out of the cabin like a shot and jumped off on
the pier. Then, without even stopping to look back,
he ran down into the city! What have you been
doing to him?”</p>

<p>Clay stood for a moment like one incapable of
speech, then he dropped into a deck-chair and
laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks. Captain
Joe and Teddy joined the others in their
criticism of his strange actions.</p>

<p>“You didn’t get too many high balls while in the
city, did you?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“You might have kept sober enough to bring
Alex. back with you!” Jule put in.</p>

<p>“Ah believe yo’ done scare dat lad off de boat!”
little Mose suggested.</p>

<p>“Well,” Clay explained, presently, “I suppose I
ought to treat the matter more seriously, for we
may have lost Chet for good, but it is funny for all
that.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you pass it around?” demanded
Case. “Let us in on the laugh!”</p>

<p>“You all know what I did with the articles we
found on Chet,” Clay responded. “Well, when I
took the valuables out of the leather bag, I put burrs
from the repair kit and pieces of broken dishes into
the bag and hid it where I thought Chet might find
it if he looked long enough.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything funny in that,” observed
Case, with a frown.</p>

<p>“Just wait! When I looked for the bag, just
now, it was gone, and the next thing I hear is that
Chet has taken to his heels. You see what has happened!”</p>

<p>“The poor little chap!” exclaimed Case. “I’m
sorry for him.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” Clay agreed, “but he ought to have
been honest with us.”</p>

<p>“We knew what to expect,” Jule suggested.
“He said he’d get the gems back if he could, didn’t
he? Now he thinks he’s got them, and is lugging
off a lot of truck not worth a cent! I call that a
shame!”</p>

<p>Clay looked thoughtful for a second and then
burst out:</p>

<p>“But is he? Look here, fellows,” he went on, excitedly,
“suppose he never took the bag at all! Suppose
Chet found it and changed his mind about running
off with it! Suppose one of the visitors took
it! Suppose that is what they were here for; suppose
Chet missed it as soon as they went away and
chased on after them!”</p>

<p>“You said the visitors were bankers!” exploded
Jule. “What about that?”</p>

<p>“One of them was, but I don’t know anything
about the others. Strange they should all be so eager
to inspect the <i>Rambler</i>! Strange they should get
off by themselves and talk in whispers! I reckon
we’re knee-deep in mystery!”</p>

<p>“Well, where did you leave Alex.?” asked Jule.
“He hasn’t come back yet!”</p>

<p>“And here’s another funny thing,” Clay went on,
without answering the question, directly. “We saw
Red, the Robber, up town, dressed like a gentleman!
Alex. followed him out of the place where we saw
him, and may have got into trouble!”</p>

<p>“Then the stealing of the bag is Red’s work!”
decided Case. “No need to guess about that any
more! How he got his men in with the banker I
don’t know, but he did it, and one of them took it,
and poor Chet saw that it was gone, and now he is
following a bag filled with crockery about the city!”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” Jule exclaimed. “It is dollars to
doughnuts that Chet got the bag himself! He said
he’d swipe it if he got a chance. You all know
that!”</p>

<p>A figure now came dashing down the pier at
break-neck speed and Alex. leaped on the deck and
dropped into a chair, wiping the sweat from his face.</p>

<p>“Did you find who he was?” asked Clay, as the
boys all gathered around Alex.</p>

<p>Alex. told the story of the steamer and the
wrecked stateroom, and ended with the talk he had
had with Red, while the boys looked on in wonder
at the odd twist things were getting into. Even
Teddy Bear seemed impressed by the mystery, Jule
declared!</p>

<p>“And how did you get away from him?” demanded
Case. “How did you get back here?”</p>

<p>“I jumped and ran, and he caught me,” was the
reply. “Then he made me promise not to say a
word about his escapade on the <i>Rambler</i> and let me
go! Can you beat it?”</p>

<p>“What did he have you locked up for?” asked
Clay. “I don’t understand that.”</p>

<p>“Just because he wanted that promise,” Alex.
suggested. “Is that the answer?”</p>

<p>“It may be,” Clay admitted, “but here’s the
question: Is he a robber or a detective? Is he on
the level, or is he just a clever scoundrel?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Alex. can judge better of that when he
knows what has taken place here,” Case suggested,
going on with the story of the disappearance of the
leather bag.</p>

<p>“Red’s gang got it,” laughed Alex., without a moment’s
hesitation, as Case finished the story. “He
knew Clay put something in the bank, and asked me
what it was. Yes, we know all about it now!”</p>

<p>“I just believe Chet took the bag, thinking the
gems were in it,” insisted Jule.</p>

<p>“We’ll never know the truth until we find the
lad,” Clay said, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Unless Red, the Robber, shows up again in a
confidential mood,” Alex. laughed.</p>

<p>“If the supplies I ordered are all in,” Clay went
on, “I think we’d better be on our way. There’s
mystery in the very air here!”</p>

<p>“If we stay here long,” Alex. prophesied, “the
coon I biffed on the shin may show up, lookin’ for
revenge, or Red may come after pay for the furniture
I smashed!”</p>

<p>“What did he say about that furniture?” grinned
Jule. “You’ve got the nerve!”</p>

<p>“He never mentioned it,” was the reply. “Say,”
the lad went on, “I believe that chap is all to the
good, after all! He seemed to think the smash act
was funny.”</p>

<p>During the afternoon Case and Mose had caught
a large fish and Chet had succeeded in bringing
down a wild duck, so the cooking of supper was an
elaborate affair. Then Clay made light biscuits and
coffee, and fried potatoes, and the boys were as
happy as well-fed boys with no one to “boss,” usually
are, except that they missed Chet.</p>

<p>After supper they discussed the proposition of
waiting there a day in the hope of finding the runaway
boy, but it was finally decided that he could
find them easier than they could find him, so they
started the motors and went on toward the Gulf.</p>

<p>The early part of the night was bright, so the
boys ran down about twenty miles, as the river ran,
and then tied up below a “tow-head” which stuck
up out of the water below an island of good size.
They found it necessary to take this precaution always,
for the wash of large steamers passing up and
down would have rattled things in the <i>Rambler</i>, if
the motor boat was not capsized.</p>

<p>At midnight the sky became overcast with threatening
clouds and the wind blew in fitful gusts.
There seemed to be no danger of their being disturbed
by visitors that night, but all the same they
thought best to station a watchman, and Case volunteered
to keep awake and see that “no one flew
away with the boat,” as he expressed it.</p>

<p>Somewhere about two o’clock in the morning, the
boy, who was having hard work keeping awake,
heard the puff and bellow of an approaching
steamer, toiling up against the strong current. Almost
at the same instant he felt a jar, as if the boat
had been struck by floating driftwood. He switched
on the prow light to see what was doing, but quickly
extinguished it as the steamer came up and a heavy
rowboat dropped away from her!</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink16'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XVI—WHAT DROPPED ON DECK</a></h2>

<p>“I guess my turning on that light started something!”
the boy mused, as he darkened the small
electric globe in the cabin and sat down to await
developments. He kept just inside the cabin door at
first, for the wind was cold and searching.</p>

<p>For a few moments he could hear the working of
oars and the push of the current on an advancing
boat, and then all was silent save the sighing of the
wind and the wash of the river, still burdened at
times with floating wreckage. It seemed to him that
the boat which had slipped away from the steamer
had anchored somewhere near the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“I fully believe,” Case grunted, as he finally left
the cabin and looked out upon the dim river from the
deck, “that if we should fly through the air on a
cloud there would be some scamp watching us from
another cloud! It’s rotten, the way we are chased
about!”</p>

<p>The boy did not know that his complaint had
found words until he heard a chuckle close to his
side and turned about to faintly distinguish the
freckled face of Alex., who stood looking over the
river to the south.</p>

<p>“You’ve got no kick coming!” Alex. declared.
“You wouldn’t go on these river trips if we found
nothing more than scenery, any more than I would!
It seems like living to be chased about, as you call it!
If it wasn’t for the mystery and adventure in the
jaunts I’d be at home in little old Chicago—and
that’s where you’d be, too!”</p>

<p>“Well,” Case returned, “I’d like to get one night
off occasionally!”</p>

<p>“What is it now?” asked Alex. “I heard the
steamer pass, but that didn’t mean anything to me.
What’s going wrong now? Tell your old uncle
Alex. all about it!”</p>

<p>“Uncle nothing!” laughed Case, restored to better
humor by the optimism of the other. “If you
want to know what’s on the string, go and get a
glass and try to find a rowboat in this mess of river
and black sky. A safety razor that won’t cut air
will be given to the first one that discovers the
boat!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Alex. “There’s a boat watching
us! All right! Now I feel better! I was beginning
to wonder when we’d have something to stir us up!”</p>

<p>“The boat dropped off when the steamer went
up,” Case explained. “I saw it under the lights,
but of course it vanished in the darkness as soon
as the big boat passed.”</p>

<p>“There’s something going on, then!” Alex. declared.
“Of course they wouldn’t know on board
the steamer in the dark, that we were here, and so
the thing which is going to happen is set to come off
on shore. I’m going to stay awake and see what it
is.”</p>

<p>“You see,” Case stated, hesitatingly, “I heard a
bump on the hull of the <i>Rambler</i>, just as the steamer
was churning into sight, around that bend, and
turned on the prow light to see about it! That’s
why the rowboat dropped off here, I take it.”</p>

<p>Alex. gave vent to a long, low whistle.</p>

<p>“Then we’ve got into the spot-light again!” he
said. “It won’t be any trouble for me to keep
awake now! Shall we tell Clay the glad news, or
let him sleep?”</p>

<p>“Oh, let him sleep! We can run this watch, all
right!”</p>

<p>While the boys whispered and listened, the long,
bellowing roar of a locomotive whistle came to their
ears from the east. Then came the distant rumble
of a train.</p>

<p>“What do you make of that?” asked Case. “I
thought we were in the heart of a wild river country,
and here come a train of cars—palace cars, I’ll go
you, at that!”</p>

<p>“About three or four miles from the river, in the
state of Mississippi,” laughed Alex., “runs the old
Yazoo &amp; Mississippi railroad. There are little towns
all along its line. Perhaps the boat dropped off the
steamer to make one of the country bergs! We
never thought of that, did we?”</p>

<p>Case pulled the other by the arm and both drew
away from the gunwale.</p>

<p>“There’s a boat out there now,” he declared, in a
whisper. “I heard the tunk of an oar then! I’ll
bet they are trying to get on board!”</p>

<p>“Got your gun?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“Sure thing I have,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“And your searchlight?”</p>

<p>“You know it!”</p>

<p>“So have I,” Alex. went on. “Now, if they try
to board the <i>Rambler</i>, we’ll lie low until they begin
to climb over the rail. Then we’ll turn on our electrics.
If they are strangers, and look like river
pirates, we’ll shoot them up! What?”</p>

<p>“But why not turn on the prow light?” asked
Case.</p>

<p>“Because we can handle the electric flashlights
quicker. If we have to show the light and shoot,
be quick to change your position after the light is
switched off. Then, if they shoot back, they won’t
hit you.”</p>

<p>There was a boat approaching. There was no
doubt about that. And the people on board of her
were doing their best to keep their movements from
being known by those of the <i>Rambler</i>. Case and
Alex. could hear the dash of oars, and now and then
a rough command. The two boys sat in silence and
waited.</p>

<p>Then, as Case and Alex. afterward complained,
something happened which “spoilt all the fun!”
Captain Joe came out of the cabin and gave forth a
series of threatening growls, and Teddy added to
the warning by saying things in bear talk!</p>

<p>The mysterious boat came on no longer. There
were still sounds of the working of a heavy craft in
a strong current, but these gradually died out.</p>

<p>“I’d like to throw you both into the river after
them!” Alex. scolded at the animals, as they came
around him, asking to be congratulated on their
success in driving off the visitors! “Now we’ll be
haunted by those fellows for a week, while if you
had kept quiet we’d have settled with them right
here!”</p>

<p>“Suppose we turn on the power and chase ’em
up?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“And give them a chance to do all the shooting!”
replied Alex. scornfully. “I’m not looking for a
watery grave in the Mississippi.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Case continued, “if you don’t want to
follow them up, just to see what they look like, perhaps
we’d better drop down a short distance. If we
can’t fight them, we don’t want to feel that they’re
right under our noses, waiting for a chance to get
us into a hole! I’d rather face a hundred men in
the open than know that one was skulking about me
in the darkness!”</p>

<p>“This is a fierce old stream for strangers to travel
on in the dark!” Alex. said.</p>

<p>“I know it, but——”</p>

<p>Before the boy could finish the sentence a faint
jar came, as if some person had caught hold of
the anchor chain and given it a pull, or hung his
weight on it.</p>

<p>“There’s our friend!” Case whispered. “Now,
get ready with your gun!”</p>

<p>In a second, while the boys listened, they heard a
hard substance fall on the deck. Alex.’s light flashed
around the gunwale, but there was no one in sight.</p>

<p>In the middle of the deck, however, still dripping
from the river, lay the leather bag which had held
the diamonds, and which had held only burrs and
broken crockery when last seen on board the <i>Rambler</i>!
Alex. picked it up, found that it was still half
full of some hard substances, and shut off the light.</p>

<p>“You saw it?” he asked of Case, as he cuddled
down by the boy’s side.</p>

<p>“Of course! The leather bag!”</p>

<p>“What do you think of it?” demanded Alex.</p>

<p>“I don’t think!” admitted Case. “I’ve lost the
power of thought!”</p>

<p>“But what did they throw it back here for?” insisted
Alex.</p>

<p>“Why did who throw it back here?” chuckled
Case.</p>

<p>“Now, look here, Smarty,” Alex. continued.
“There are only four persons who could have taken
that bag from the boat, the cashier and his two
friends, and Chet.”</p>

<p>“Unless the dog ate it, or Teddy threw it overboard.”</p>

<p>“Oh, quit your foolishness! Now, which one of
the four is out there in the river? Whoever it is has
a sense of humor, for the tossing of the bag back
shows that the situation is appreciated.”</p>

<p>“You notice the steamer came UP the river?”
asked Case.</p>

<p>“Yes; what of it?” demanded Alex. “I don’t
see anything in that.”</p>

<p>“Well, that shows that whoever threw the bag on
deck came from down stream! It shows, too, that
we have been watched every minute, for reasons
which we don’t know anything about!”</p>

<p>“Yes, in order to keep track of us they might
have taken the railroad down the river bank and
then taken a steamer up, so as to meet us on the way
down! I see something in it now. But who is it?”</p>

<p>“It may be Chet!” suggested Case. “He may
have returned the bag just to show us that he knows
about the removal of the diamonds.”</p>

<p>“I just believe Chet is out there somewhere, and
that he would come on board if he knew we wouldn’t
raise a row about the way he left us!” declared
Alex.</p>

<p>“I give it all up!” Case returned. “It’s your
watch now, and I’m going to bed! If there’s anything
good to eat thrown on deck out of the darkness,
just wake me up, otherwise let me alone. I’ll
hunt up my dream book to-morrow and find what it
says about leather bags dropping out of the sky!”</p>

<p>Alex. sat alone in the dim night, watching the
river and the dark bottom lands of the island for a
long time before anything attracted his attention.
Then a light, like that made by a camp-fire, sprang
up on the Mississippi side of the river.</p>

<p>He could see figures moving about in front of the
blaze, but of course could not distinguish faces.
Presently the low, weird chant of a plantation song
came over the waters. It was evident that a gang of
negroes, possibly railroad repair men, was passing
the night in camp on the shore.</p>

<p>As Alex. listened to the plaintive songs he heard
a splash in the water at the side of the boat, and
shot his light in that direction. A stick was floating
away, and the boy concluded that it was that which
had made the noise he had heard.</p>

<p>He heard the negroes come to the bank of the
river to gather driftwood for the fire, and heard
their drawling voices saying something of the river
going down fast, but could not catch the full import
of their words.</p>

<p>The companionship of the fire and the voices was
something to the boy, and he sat until daylight began
to show in perfect contentment. Then he went into
the cabin to get a line, it being his idea to surprise
the boys with a fish breakfast.</p>

<p>He looked at the sleeping faces for a moment and
started when he came to a rug in the corner where
Mose usually slept! Captain Joe was there, his nose
in his paws, but Mose was not there! Alex. searched
the boat. The negro boy was gone! The amazed
boy half pulled Clay out of his bunk and began the
story of the night.</p>

<p>“We’re not yet out of the enchanted land,” he
said. “We are still seeing things! The leather bag
comes back out of the sky, and Mose goes up in the
air. I’m for getting down to the Gulf right soon.”</p>

<p>“Have you looked in the bag for any solution of
the puzzle?” asked Clay. “There may be a note of
some kind there: a note of explanation. See?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” declared Alex., pointing over the side, and
not answering the question about the bag, “I see
that we are stuck in the mud, and not likely to get
out until another flood, a year, or perhaps two years,
off.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink17'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XVII—GETTING OUT OF THE MUD</a></h2>

<p>Clay’s face plainly expressed the dismay he felt
as he bent over the gunwale and looked downward
in the growing light of the morning. The <i>Rambler</i>
lay in a bed of soft, oozy mud, with harder ground
between her and the “tow-head.”</p>

<p>“I presume,” Alex. said, “that the people of this
country will be glad to see that the river lowered in
the night! So are we?”</p>

<p>“We ought to have provided against this,” Clay
exclaimed, in self-reproach. “We might just as
well have anchored a few yards farther down.
What next, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“The longer we wait before getting the motor
boat into the water,” Alex. said, “the harder work
it will be, for the river is lowering every minute.”</p>

<p>Clay scratched his head and estimated the distance
to deep water.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to put on our bathing suits and take
to the mud,” he decided. “By all taking hold, we
may be able to get her out of this mess. Nice job it
is, too!”</p>

<p>“Sure!” Alex. grinned. “Mud baths are healthful!
There’s Mike Cogan, the Chicago politician,
he goes to take mud baths twice a year! If we had
him here now we wouldn’t charge him a cent for his
cure! I think he’d like it, too.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wake Case and Jule, and we’ll get right at
it,” Clay said. “I wish a lot of husky plantation
hands would happen along in a shanty boat.”</p>

<p>“There was a group of them over on the Mississippi
side last night,” Alex. explained. “We might
get them, if they are there yet. Say,” he continued,
with a grin, “I believe that is where the little coon
went! He saw the camp-fire and heard the plantation
songs, and couldn’t remain away from his own
people!”</p>

<p>“In that case,” Clay suggested, “the little rascal
will be back soon.”</p>

<p>“Never can tell about boys of the Mose stripe,”
Alex. predicted. “He may follow the men off and
never show up here again.”</p>

<p>Clay started for the cabin to arouse Case and Jule
and then turned back to ask:</p>

<p>“Did that pocket book—the bag, rather, that had
the diamonds in, make its appearance before or after
Mose disappeared?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know when Mose lit out,” was the reply.
“At one time I heard a splash in the river and looked
to see what it was about, but Mose was not in sight
then. There was only a large stick floating in the
stream. Still, he might have gone at that time. If
he did, he left long after the bag was thrown on
deck. What about it?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking that he might have followed off
the person who threw the bag,” Clay explained,
“though I can’t understand why he should have
gone away so secretly. Did the dog make any remarks
about the time the bag reached the deck?”</p>

<p>“Nix on Captain Joe! He’s getting too sleepy!
He stirred only once in the night, and that was when
the boat was coming up to us. He frightened the
pirates away, when Case and I had planned to shoot
’em up!”</p>

<p>“Then,” concluded Clay, “when we reach the
truth of it, we’ll discover that it was Chet who was
around here last night, and who threw the bag on
deck. You know we have been thinking, all along,
that he might have taken it.”</p>

<p>“That’s what Jule insists on,” Alex. returned,
“while the rest of us think one of the visitors took
it, and that Chet chased off the boat to get it back,
not knowing that the diamonds had been taken out
of it.”</p>

<p>“It seems clear now,” Clay replied, “that Chet
took it. In the first place, there is no good reason
for supposing that the visitors would find the bag,
or take it if they did find it; or take any trouble to
return it after they had found its contents of no
value. Chet got it, all right, and, disappointed and
chagrined at the substitution we had made, he lost
no time in throwing it back at us.”</p>

<p>“Chet was broke, wasn’t he?” asked Alex., with
a sly grin.</p>

<p>“So far as I know, yes. Anyway, he didn’t look
like a millionaire when we took him on board and
fixed him out with a suit of your clothes!”</p>

<p>“Then how would he ride up the river in a
steamer, or ride down the river to the next town to
take the steamer, or hire a rowboat and pay the
captain of the steamer for letting him off in his boat
as soon as he saw the light of the <i>Rambler</i>?”</p>

<p>“You smash all my solutions,” laughed Clay.
“Now, give me one of your own, so I can smash
that,”</p>

<p>“I ain’t no prophet!” grinned the red-headed
boy, “but I’m gambling that when we get down to
the bottom of matters we’ll find Red, the Robber, in
the mess!”</p>

<p>“We have already found him in the mess,”
laughed Clay. “He knew, according to your story,
that I had put something in the safety vaults! Besides,
he seemed to own the steamer you were on,
didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He seemed to be the boss.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we quit guessing and get the <i>Rambler</i>
out of the mud,” suggested Clay, then.</p>

<p>Case and Jule were called out on deck, and the
lads, clad only in their bathing suits, were soon wallowing
in the soft mud, which was so deep that they
could get no footing at all, and so could not lift on
the boat. In fact, the more they tried to lift the
boat, to slide it toward deep water, the deeper she
seemed to sink.</p>

<p>“We’re up against a beautiful proposition!” Jule
exclaimed, climbing back on deck and leaning over
the gunwale. “If we jar the boat any more, we’ll
have to take a trip to China and pull it through
from the other side!”</p>

<p>Clay plowed out of the mud and made his way to
the “tow-head” where he began examining the
growth of willows. He seemed satisfied with what
he saw, for he began cutting the long wands and
called to the others to join him.</p>

<p>“What’s doing?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“This ain’t no island improvement corporation!”
Alex. grinned.</p>

<p>“I know what he’s up to!” Jule shouted, and in
a second he was off the deck, cutting willows and
throwing them into a heap at the edge of the hard
ground.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to make mattresses of these willows,”
Jule declared, wiping the sweat from his face.
“I read about that in a paper not long ago.”</p>

<p>“To sleep on?” asked Alex., with a wink at Case.</p>

<p>“Silly!” roared Jule. “Get busy, both of you.”</p>

<p>When a great stack of the willow wands had been
cut, Clay and Jule began roughly braiding them together.
In this way two mattresses a foot in thickness
and nearly twelve feet square were constructed
before noon. During all this time the boys had seen
nothing of Chet, of Mose, or of the negroes who had
camped on the shore the previous night. They had
also overlooked breakfast!</p>

<p>The novelty of their employment had so engaged
their attention that they felt no need of food until
Teddy appeared on the deck sitting up like a man,
begging for his breakfast! Then Alex. threw down
the wands he was carrying to Clay, who was doing
the weaving at that time, and sprang over to the
boat with a chuckle of amusement.</p>

<p>“You’re all right, Teddy Bear!” he cried. “We
don’t know enough to eat when we’re hungry, do
we? We’ll show ’em what it is to feed up right
without delay.”</p>

<p>“What you going to get for dinner?” demanded
Jule, putting a hand to his stomach to show how
empty it was. “I want a whale fried whole!”</p>

<p>“Get your whale, then,” advised Alex.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you think I can’t!” laughed Jule.
“Pass out my line and rod and I’ll show you
whether I’m a fisherman or not!”</p>

<p>Alex. did as requested and Jule waded through
the mud to where there was a bit of hard ground,
next the island, with a little swirl of water close by.</p>

<p>“Watch me now!” he cried.</p>

<p>But the boys did not care to watch him. Case
and Clay continued the work of braiding mattresses,
and Alex. got out a gun and sat on deck watching
for ducks, of which there were plenty in that vicinity.
Presently a yell from Jule called the attention
of the others to him. He was fighting a fish
which seemed to the astonished boys to be not less
than ten feet in length, and the fish was pulling him
down stream.</p>

<p>“Give me a hand!” the boy shouted. “He’s pulling
me in!”</p>

<p>“Let go the line!” cried Alex.</p>

<p>“And lose it!” answered Jule. “Not much!
Give me a hand!”</p>

<p>Case and Clay both rushed to the boy’s assistance,
and with great effort a monster fish was landed in
the mud. Jule was jubilant.</p>

<p>“The biggest catch of the trip!” he declared.
“Who says I can’t produce a whale when I feel the
need of a whole one fried?”</p>

<p>Case and Clay leaned back and screamed with
amusement. Alex. looked on with a grin which
was more provoking than the laughter of the others.</p>

<p>“Have all the fun you can,” roared Jule, “but
don’t get gay!”</p>

<p>“Throw him back into the river!” Clay advised,
poking at the catch. “That is just a big catfish,
and no one eats them save the negroes! They’re
tougher than the tripe at Bill’s restaurant, in
Chicago!”</p>

<p>“I guess you won’t throw him away!” yelled
Jule.</p>

<p>“All right!” Clay answered. “Take him to bed
with you, if you want to, but kindly see if you can’t
get a bass for our dinner. There are plenty of them
in here.”</p>

<p>Reluctantly Jule started the catfish back toward
his natural element, and the big fellow seemed to
thank him with a parting wave of his tail as he took
to the water. In a few moments he had a fine large
bass, weighing six or eight pounds, and before long
Alex. had a couple of ducks, so work was suspended
while dinner was cooked and eaten. After the meal
the work was continued until Case declared there
were enough willow mattresses on hand to float a
city.</p>

<p>Then the mattresses were hauled alongside the
<i>Rambler</i> and a considerable part of the cargo of the
boat was put out on them. Thus lightened, and
having a strong footing, the lads had no difficulty in
pushing the <i>Rambler</i> out into deep water.</p>

<p>“What shall we do with the mattresses now?”
asked Clay, as the boat swung off the bottom. “We
have spent too much time on them to throw them
away!”</p>

<p>“Tow them along,” advised Case. “It won’t
cost us anything to tote them along, and we may
have use for them. A man could build a tent on
them, by fastening them together, and live there.
I’m strong for taking them with us.”</p>

<p>This was finally agreed to, and the boys were
about to start down the stream again when a shout
from the Mississippi side of the river attracted their
attention.</p>

<p>“There’s that little coon!” laughed Case. “See
the rascal! He’s going to swim to the boat, or going
to try to!”</p>

<p>“He never can do it,” Clay declared. “We’ll
have to swing the <i>Rambler</i> over that way and pick
him up. He’s making a swift run, though!”</p>

<p>“Well,” Alex. replied, “just you look behind him
and see what he’s running from.”</p>

<p>Half a dozen negroes and one white man were
now seen running down the river bank in pursuit of
Mose. They seemed to redouble their exertions
when the <i>Rambler</i> shot over toward the boy, but
were obliged to halt when the boy was picked up
and the boat went on down stream, towing the willow
mattresses in her wake!</p>

<p>Mose dropped down on deck, panting and rolling
his eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah’m scared white!” he chattered. “Fo’ de
Lawd, dat’s de man what trun dis coon an’ Captain
Joe into the ribber up no’th! Ah’s scared of him!”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink18'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XVIII—SWEPT INTO A SWAMP</a></h2>

<p>“Who threw you and Captain Joe into the river,
up north?” demanded Jule. “Wake up and tell
us what’s the matter with you. What were those
people chasing you for?”</p>

<p>Mose only sat up on deck and rolled his eyes as the
<i>Rambler</i> increased the distance between the pursuers
and himself. Seeing that he was now beyond their
reach, he arose and leaned over the gunwale and
made funny insulting faces at them.</p>

<p>“What does he mean?” asked Jule, turning to
Clay. “Who’s chasing him?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember how Sam, the Robber, the
fellow who, with Red, captured the <i>Rambler</i> in the
bayou, threw the boy and the dog out, and how they
lay in the grounds at the old house until dusk and
then came to your rescue?” asked Clay. “You
must have a poor memory, I think.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know whether it was Red or Sam who
threw him in,” Jule explained.</p>

<p>“So that’s Sam over there with the negroes?”
questioned Alex. “What did you do to them,
Mose? Where did you go last night? What do
you mean by forming an exploring expedition all by
yourself and having all the fun?”</p>

<p>“Ah went ’shore to hear de singin’,” the boy replied,
“an’ dey cotch me stealin’ de yaller leg
chicken, an’ say de’s goin’ to beat dis coon up
plenty!”</p>

<p>“You swam all that way to steal a chicken?”
asked Jule. “Was it cooked?”</p>

<p>“Yaller leg chicken!” insisted the boy.</p>

<p>“Was it cooked?” persisted Jule. “Where did
they get it?”</p>

<p>“Dey say it done lef’ de roos’ an’ follow dem into
camp!”</p>

<p>“Did you eat a whole one?” asked Case. “A
whole yellow-legged chicken?”</p>

<p>Mose grinned and showed the whites of his eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah shore did!” he replied, and Jule declared
that he would willingly have helped him do it if he
had only known about it!</p>

<p>“What were they talking about last night?” asked
Clay, as the <i>Rambler</i> turned a bend and lost sight
of the negroes and Sam, still gesticulating fiercely,
on the east shore.</p>

<p>“They’re sho’ goin’ to get you-all!” was the
reply. “They goin’ to steal dis boat, first thing you
know. Ah’m scart ob dat white man!”</p>

<p>The little fellow could tell very little of the talk
he had heard while detained in the negro camp. He
knew that Sam, the Robber, was there with the
negroes, and that he was continually urging them to
help him secure the <i>Rambler</i>, but that was all. Of
their plans he knew nothing but this.</p>

<p>During the afternoon the boys passed a great
many steamers, going up the river, some with supplies
for those who had been made homeless by the
flood. Fortunately the levees had held, but the
water had filled in back of them, in some instances
and destroyed much property. The lagoons and
swamps up river were still flooded, and in places
farming land was still being washed away.</p>

<p>All the way down, until night closed in, they saw
gangs of negroes on the levees, fishing drift wood
out of the water. In some instances small out-houses
were brought out in good condition. One shanty
boat the boys saw had the cupola of a house set up
on the prow, and a farm bell in the top of it was
ringing as the raft bobbed in the currents of the
river. Now and then families were seen gathered
on the levees, evidently waiting for a steamer to
take them off.</p>

<p>The boys kept up good speed until night and then
tied up in a small cove on the lower side of an island,
not far from the Mississippi side.</p>

<p>“We have been going pretty fast,” Clay observed,
as the boat was worked in behind a point so as to be
out of the wash of the steamers. “We haven’t a
thing to do until we get back to Chicago, and we
can take all the time we want getting back. How is
that for a peaceful life, Mose?” he added, turning to
the little negro boy.</p>

<p>Mose showed a mouthful of white teeth and a
pair of chalk-white eyeballs.</p>

<p>“It takes a corkscrew to get conversation out of
Mose!” Jule observed.</p>

<p>“I think I can make him talk,” laughed Alex.
“Mose,” he went on, “I’ll give you a plate of honey
for supper if you’ll tell me where Chet is and who
threw the leather bag on deck last night?”</p>

<p>“Some one fro’ what?” asked the little fellow.</p>

<p>“Some one threw this on the boat in the night,”
Alex. answered, handing the bag to the boy. “Did
you hear any one around before you left?”</p>

<p>The negro boy rolled his eyes for a minute then
took the bag and held it under the nose of Captain
Joe, who sniffed at it for a second and then walked
back to the place in the cabin where Chet had slept.</p>

<p>“De dawg sho’ know who fro’ dat bag!” he said,
patting Captain Joe on the head.</p>

<p>“That shows why the dog didn’t make a row
when the person who threw it got close enough to
the boat to heave it on deck!” Jule laughed.</p>

<p>“It takes a little coon to find out things about
animals!” grinned Alex. “Here we’ve been studying
over who tossed the bag, and Mose settles the
question in a minute. That is sure some coon!”</p>

<p>“There’s an affinity between a boy and a dog,
anyway!” Clay laughed.</p>

<p>“I wonder if the kid is right?” Case questioned.</p>

<p>The boys discussed the matter during supper, and,
right or wrong, Mose was given his plate of honey,
which he was obliged to divide with Teddy!</p>

<p>The night passed away without incident, and
early morning found the <i>Rambler</i> on her way to the
Gulf again. The day was not different from other
days for a week. The boys passed plantations and
villages, swamps and lagoons, which seemed to have
escaped the force of the flood, but now and then
came to a wrecked cabin toppling from a bank.</p>

<p>They secured a supply of gasoline at a small
place near the Arkansas line and at night found
themselves in the heart of a desolate country. When
they tied up they were at the mouth of a lagoon
which seemed to lead into a great swamp.</p>

<p>“It is a sure thing that no leather bags will be
thrown on deck to-night,” Clay observed, as supper
was prepared. “We are even off the track of the
steamers, for they seem to stick to the opposite side
of the stream.”</p>

<p>“This would be a dandy spot for a band of river
pirates to inhabit,” Jule added.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk about pirates!” admonished Clay.
“You’ll have Mose turning white again. Some
day he’ll turn so white with fright that he will never
turn black again, and he wouldn’t like that, would
you, Mose?”</p>

<p>“Ah’s ’tented wif mah color,” answered the boy.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, as long as you are on the boat,”
Alex. put in, “but you jump into the lagoon and
see how long you’ll last. An alligator will leave a
fat pig any time to make a dinner off a black boy!”</p>

<p>“Quit scaring the boy!” exclaimed Case. “First
thing you know, he will be afraid to swim ashore to
steal a yellow-legged chicken roasted by tramps!”</p>

<p>When darkness fell a soft wind came out of the
west and a slow rain began falling. It was wild and
uncanny outside, but bright and warm in the cabin.
Alex. entertained his chums for a time with stories
of the Mississippi, and explained how Grant had
shortened the stream by cutting a new channel at
Vicksburg, but all were tired, and by nine o’clock all
were asleep save Jule, who was to stand guard that
night, and Mose who was moving restlessly about.</p>

<p>“Come on into the cabin, Mose,” Jule finally
ordered, “and go to bed, like a good coon! You’ll
get wet out on deck!”</p>

<p>The boy entered the cabin and sat down near the
stove, in which a small fire was burning. Jule regarded
him attentively.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you to-night?” he finally
asked.</p>

<p>“Ah hear a roar!” was the reply.</p>

<p>“That’s the wind in the cypress trees,” Jule explained.</p>

<p>“Is it de win’ makes de ribber come up?” asked
Mose, in a moment.</p>

<p>“Is the river rising?” asked Jule, going to the
door and switching on the prow light. “It ought
to be running down.”</p>

<p>By the light of the electric the boy saw that the
river was indeed rising. Little knolls which were
above water when the boat had been anchored were
now under a swift current. The river was sweeping
past the mouth of the lagoon with a new force.</p>

<p>Presently trees and wreckage of different sorts
were seen drifting down, and there came a rushing
sound which added greatly to the weirdness of the
scene.</p>

<p>“This beats me!” Jule muttered. “The flood
has been going down for nearly a week. There
must have been heavy rains up to the north, and at
the sources of the rivers emptying into the Mississippi.
I wonder if it will do anything to us?”</p>

<p>At that moment a timber crashed against the
<i>Rambler</i>, jarring it considerably.</p>

<p>Clay and the others were out of their bunks in a
minute, and out on deck to see what had taken
place. Alex. was the first one to grasp the situation.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to turn on the motors to hold this
boat,” he said. “The anchor lies in the mud, and
will pull away at the first push of a current. First
thing we know, we’ll be down there in a cypress
swamp!”</p>

<p>“You’re excited!” Case called out. “We passed
the flood two days ago.”</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble,” Alex. explained. “We
passed the flood! The crest of it is still to the north
of us. It has undoubtedly been raining up river, and
that has swelled the volume of water.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that we got down the river in advance
of the flood?” demanded Case.</p>

<p>“We have been going a little faster than the
current, haven’t we, notwithstanding our tying up
nights?” Alex. asked. “This little boat has been
going some! To-night the crest of the flood overtakes
us. See?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look reasonable!” Case insisted.
“I don’t believe it!”</p>

<p>“The kid is right,” Clay declared. “I have often
read about boats meeting the flood the second time,
once when they passed it, and once when it caught
up with them.”</p>

<p>The roaring sound which Mose had referred to
now grew louder, sounding like the rush of a long
and heavily loaded freight train.</p>

<p>While the lads listened, hardly knowing what to
do to protect themselves, Mose pointed a shaking
hand at a spot far down the lagoon. Clay looked
and saw a great blaze on what seemed a wooded
knoll to the west of the river.</p>

<p>“There’s a camp down there!” he said.</p>

<p>“That makes it nice!” grinned Alex. “No
honest men ever made camp in that hole at this
season of the year! It is dollars to tripe that if we
don’t put on power the crest of the flood will wash
us down, when the full strength comes, and beach us
among a band of river pirates! If we don’t get
under way up stream we’ll have do to something to
make the anchor hold!”</p>

<p>While the boys were discussing some way of accomplishing
this, for they did not like the idea of
breasting the flood, the crest of the flood came seething
down the stream, a wall of water four feet high!
It swept over the point of land between the river and
the bayou and dashed against the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>The anchor held for a minute, then the boys knew
that they were in motion. The current seemed
stronger there than in the river itself.</p>

<p>“The water is cutting a new channel below,”
Clay shouted, as the <i>Rambler</i> was swept away,
“and we are headed for that swamp. Now, we are
in a peck of trouble!”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink19'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XIX—PILGRIMS FROM OLD CHICAGO</a></h2>

<p>The “peck of trouble” referred to as their portion
by Clay turned out to be a full bushel, and good
measure at that, in a very short time. Although the
boys turned on the power—a thing they should have
done long before—as soon as the crest of water
came in sight, the <i>Rambler</i> was pitched down toward
the swamp like a chip.</p>

<p>If the boys had been able to direct her course,
they might have held her in the current, and so kept
out of the muck hole into which she was swept when
the water cut around a bend, driving straight on the
shore. But just as the craft was getting under control
a mass of limbs and cane-brake tangled her propellers,
and she went down with the flood, striking,
as has been said, in a swamp where the head of the
bayou had been, and into which the water still
poured.</p>

<p>It was pitch dark out on the river and in the
swamp, but the lights of the <i>Rambler</i> cast a circle
of illumination about the spot where she lay, so that
the black, bubbling water, with all the unclean reptiles
it was forcing forth from their haunts, was in
full view. It was carrying wreckage now, and this
was piling up between the current and the boat,
shutting off all chances of backing out, even if the
current would have permitted it. It was indeed a
desperate situation.</p>

<p>The motor boat had come to a stop against two
monster cypress trees, between which she had
wedged her nose. Only for this she might have been
carried farther into the swamp, the water being deep
for some distance ahead.</p>

<p>During the whirling passage down the bayou,
while the boat was bumping against tree trunks and
bounding off with a jar and a swish to go swinging
around again, like a foolish dancer doing the time
limit, Mose had clung tightly to one of Clay’s legs.
At the very beginning of that mad race he had
caught sight of a couple of alligators, and was in
deadly fear that they would climb on board and
make a meal of him!</p>

<p>When the boat finally lodged between the giant
trees, the little negro boy bounded from the deck
and, seizing hold of a mass of vines, clambered up
the tree to the west like a young monkey! Believing
that he would have to help the others up, he carried
a rope with him! Finally, sitting astride of a limb,
he called down what he considered very good advice
to the boys on the boat.</p>

<p>“Dey done get yo’, sho’!” he warned. “Catch
on de rope an’ shin up!”</p>

<p>Serious as the situation was, with the water trinkling
in over the stern of the motor boat, the boys
grinned at each other at the fright of the boy.</p>

<p>“Come on down!” Alex. called. “If the boat
should break away from the trees, you would be
left alone in the swamp. Come on down and help
get the boat out of this blessed swamp! You may
get out with your rope and tow her if you want to!”
he added, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“Fo’ de Lawd!” cried Mose, shuddering at the
idea of getting into water inhabited by monsters
who would leave a fat pig to feast off a black boy!</p>

<p>At least that was what one of the boys had said
to him!</p>

<p>Attracted by the strange lights, walking and
creeping things now began gathering in the shadows
at the rim of the circle of light. Once Clay caught
sight of the soft, appealing eyes of a deer, and now
and then the howls of a swamp cat came to their
ears above the roaring of the flood. Great water
snakes struck their heads above the surface and
looked, red-eyed, and hostile, at the boys.</p>

<p>Swamp creatures with soft fur and frightened
eyes crouched on fallen trees and scanned the deck
as a possible refuge. To make the scene more desolate
still, if possible, two round-eyed owls answered
each other’s cries from a near-by cypress.</p>

<p>“Say,” Jule whispered to Clay, during a little
lull in the rain, “there’s a man by that tree. I’ve
been watching him a long time. Look at him!”</p>

<p>Clay followed the line of the pointing finger and
laughed.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s a bear!” he shouted. “A swamp
bear—one of the kind Teddy Roosevelt came down
here to shoot when he was president! Let him
alone and he’ll let us alone. They fight like devils
when wounded or molested.”</p>

<p>The boys all agreed to let the bear alone, but Captain
Joe and Teddy seemed to have notions of hospitality.
The dog barked invitingly, and Teddy did
a stunt of bear talk which brought the wanderer one
tree nearer to the boat. He was now in the
circle of light, and could get no nearer without
swimming.</p>

<p>“He sees Teddy and wants to ask his advice!”
Jule laughed.</p>

<p>At that moment Mose, noting that the boys were
gazing fixedly in one direction, turned his eyes that
way and saw the bear. The shriek he let out might,
it seemed, have been heard in New Orleans, if the
wind had been blowing in that direction!</p>

<p>“Ah’s a gone coon!” he wailed, after that one
yell. “Ah’s a goin’ whar de good niggers go!
Good bear! Good bear!” he added coaxingly.</p>

<p>The bear looked upon the scene for a moment
longer with disapproving eyes and then turned
away. For a moment he was seen walking on
jammed logs, alternately wading through shallow
places, and then he was lost in the darkness.</p>

<p>“There!” Alex. called out to Mose, “you’ve
frightened our bear off!”</p>

<p>“Dat yo’ bear?” asked Mose. “Den yo’ keep
yo’ animile out our ya’d!”</p>

<p>Although frequently invited to return to the boat,
Mose insisted on keeping his place in the tree. Now
and then he called out that a bear or a deer was
about to board the <i>Rambler</i>, but for the most part
he sat still, looking about for more things to be
frightened at!</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> was now securely fastened in between
the two trees, standing on a level, or floating
on a level, rather. There was considerable water
under the deck, it having worked its way down
through the joints about the hatches, and the boys
proceeded to lift all available covers and bail it out.</p>

<p>“How are we ever going to get out of here?”
asked Jule, working away with a basin and a sponge.
“These trees will hold us forever.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to cut them down, Silly!” answered
Case. “Just as soon as the water goes down, we’ll
crawl out on one of the mattresses and fix the propellers.”</p>

<p>“Mattresses!” answered Jule. “They drifted
away long ago.”</p>

<p>“Look ahead and see,” remarked Case, and Jule
did so.</p>

<p>The willow and brake mattresses which had been
towed down stream were loose from the motor boat,
but they were in sight, having lodged against the
mud bank farther in the swamp. They could be
reached, the boys figured, by a little wading after
the flood subsided, which it was certain to do before
long.</p>

<p>“You see,” Case went on, “the trees will hold
the boat up, like it was in a dry dock, and we can fix
the propellers and the leak and then chop down the
trees and get out. Perhaps we can follow this channel
out to the river. If there wasn’t an opening
somewhere, the current here wouldn’t be so fierce!”</p>

<p>“There may be a channel,” Clay agreed, “but if
there is it must be full of standing trees and hidden
snags. If we ever get out of here, we’d better run
back to the main channel, and keep out of such holes
in future!”</p>

<p>“There wouldn’t be any fun in river trips,”
laughed Alex., swinging an axe at the head of a
water snake which was trying to get up on the deck,
“if it wasn’t for the adventure there is in it! I
wouldn’t have missed this for anything!”</p>

<p>With the last word of this endorsement of the
situation on his lips Alex. took a header over the
gunwale of the boat into the water! A great trunk
had bunted the <i>Rambler</i> on the port side, and she
had tipped so as to knock the boy off his feet and
over the railing before he could make up his mind
what was coming off!</p>

<p>“Wow!” cried Clay, as the boy came, spluttering
to the surface.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t miss this for anything!” roared
Case.</p>

<p>“Bring a couple of snakes and an alligator out
with you!” requested Jule.</p>

<p>Mose, sitting on the limb, high up in the tree,
called down to the boy that a water snake was trying
to get into his pocket, and that an alligator was nosing
about his leg.</p>

<p>Disregarding all comment and advice, Alex.
crawled back on deck and sat looking wrathfully
into the flood. But his anger did not last long.</p>

<p>“If that log hadn’t come along,” he said, “I
should have forgotten my bath. When it comes
daylight, I’m going to get up a race with that alligator,
with the snake as referee! Mose can enter
if he wants to!”</p>

<p>Mose shivered at the thought. He was now
climbing higher. When near the top he gave another
yell and hustled down to a lower limb, where he sat
with his hands clinging tightly to the trunk.</p>

<p>“Fo’ de Lawd’s sake!” he shrieked.</p>

<p>“What is it now?” asked Jule. “If you don’t
come down I’ll shoot you!”</p>

<p>Mose pointed to the rim of the light zone and
cried that the river robbers had come to get the boat.
The boys looked where he pointed and saw three
young men standing in a submerged grove of cypress
trees. All were armed and all were bearded
and forbidding in appearance. As the boys looked
one stepped forward.</p>

<p>“Just a second,” Clay called. “That is near
enough!”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink20'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XX—THE DARKEY UP THE TREE</a></h2>

<p>While Case talked with the young man Clay
went back into the cabin to talk with Alex., who
was now changing into dry clothing.</p>

<p>“Do you think the story that man is telling is
all right?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I think he is telling the truth about the river
thieves,” Alex. replied.</p>

<p>“I was wondering if that wasn’t just a bait to
help them get on board.”</p>

<p>“It may be, but there are river robbers in this
section. They told us that where we bought the
gasoline. These may be the robbers, for all I know,
but we ought to make sure of that before turning
them down. They’ll starve here, if they have lost
their boat and provisions. Of course they can get
wild game, but I don’t see how they are going to
cook it. We ought to give them a chance, anyway.”</p>

<p>Clay went back to the deck and listened to the
conversation between Case and the visitor, who
seemed a little annoyed at the doubting of his word.</p>

<p>“Where did you live in Chicago?” he heard Case
ask.</p>

<p>“In furnished rooms on Elizabeth street, near
Washington boulevard,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Where did you work?” was the next question,
impertinent and personal, but seemingly necessary
at that time.</p>

<p>“At a machine shop on Clinton street, not far
from West Madison.</p>

<p>“Then you are machinists?”</p>

<p>“Yes, all of us. Business is dull in our line just
now, and we thought we’d make a hit with ourselves
by spending a winter in the south.”</p>

<p>“When did you leave Chicago?”</p>

<p>“We left Chicago last September,” answered the
man, turning toward the rail. “We expect to get
back sometime during the next century, if all
Chicago boys are as hospitable as you are! Now,
with your permission, I’ll go back to my friends.”</p>

<p>“How do you know we are from Chicago?”
asked Clay, stepping forward.</p>

<p>The other laughed lightly and pointed to the
boat’s name on articles scattered about.</p>

<p>“But, aside from that,” he said, “we’d know you
anywhere. The Chicago newspapers carried a lot of
feature stuff about your boat and your trips.”</p>

<p>“All right, stranger,” one of the three answered,
in rather a pleasant tone of voice. “Just as you
say!”</p>

<p>“What do you want?” asked Alex., still shivering
from his cold bath.</p>

<p>“We want a ride out of this consarned swamp,”
was the reply.</p>

<p>“How did you get in here?” asked Clay. “Get
out the way you got in!” he added.</p>

<p>“Our shanty boat is smashed to flinders and our
grub is gone,” complained the other. “It don’t
look as if we could walk out of here, does it?”</p>

<p>“Was that your fire we saw?” asked Case, drawing
closer to the gunwale.</p>

<p>“We had a fire before the flood pounced down
upon us,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” asked Clay, facing the
others. “If they are on the square we can’t leave
them here. They would starve!”</p>

<p>“They may be pirates!” suggested Jule.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” Case declared. “They don’t
look the part. Besides, if they had designs on the
boat, they could have picked us off in the darkness,
and we’d never have known where the bullets came
from. They’re all right!”</p>

<p>“One of you come aboard,” Clay instructed,
“and we’ll see what you look like.”</p>

<p>In plain view of the boys the man who had done
the talking handed his gun to a companion and
struck out for the boat, walking on logs part of the
way, wading part of the way, and swimming when
he could do neither. In a moment he was on deck.</p>

<p>“The three of us,” he explained, “were out of
work at Chicago. We had a little cash, and decided
to come down here and spend the winter where we
wouldn’t have room-rent or restaurant bills to pay.
We thought we could cut and market enough fish-poles
out of the brake swamps to pay our way back
in the spring.”</p>

<p>“That wasn’t a bad idea!” Jule declared.</p>

<p>“We were getting along all right,” the other
went on, “until the river thieves began troubling us.
They stole our food, and at last began stealing our
poles. We were getting ready to go out when the
flood smashed our shanty boat into smithereens.
Now we are up against it, unless you take us with
you. And,” he added, with a quick glance around,
“you’d better take us on board, for the thieves are
back there in the swamp, with their envious eyes
fixed on this boat. They are mostly negroes, and
escaped convicts.”</p>

<p>“You ought to know that we’ve got to be careful,”
Clay said, as the man was about to leave the
boat. “We don’t know anything about you, except
what you have told us, but we’re going to take a
chance on you. Tell your friends to come on
board.”</p>

<p>In five minutes the three were in the cabin, trying
on some of Clay’s clothes, for their own were not
only wet but they oozed black muck. When they
were dressed again they passed their revolvers over
to Clay, with the statement that they wouldn’t need
them unless the river pirates took a hand in the
game that night.</p>

<p>“Have the ruffians been here long?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“About a month ago,” was the reply, “a lot of negroes
broke away from a convict camp off to the west
somewhere. They came into this swamp and built
a camp on a knoll, which must, by the way, be under
water now. They are murderers, housebreakers
and sneak thieves of the most desperate kind. We
tried to make friends with them, but it was of no
use. They think their camp is unknown, and so
object to our getting out and telling where it is. I
half believe they will try to keep you from getting
out for the same reason.”</p>

<p>“If it is all the same to you boys,” another of the
visitors said, “we’d like something to eat. We were
half starved when we came on board. I think I can
catch a fish or shoot a duck, so our supper won’t
cost you anything only the bother of having us
around. What do you say? Do we eat?”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” cried Alex., sticking his head
out of the cabin, “and when you are out after game
get enough for me a little lunch. I haven’t had anything
to eat since dark!”</p>

<p>“Is that rowboat at the side all right?” asked
the visitor, pointing to the boat which had been
found up the river. “If it is, I’ll get a little ways
from the motor boat, in the shadows, and see what
I can do getting ducks.”</p>

<p>“The boat is all right,” Alex. answered, “and
I’ll go with you. I’m beginning to feel the lack of
adventure. I get awfully tired of this monotony
sometimes!”</p>

<p>They all laughed at the idea of there being any
monotony in the situation, there in the swamp, with
the river roaring around them and the watchful
thieves in the thicket, and Alex. seemed quite annoyed
at the thought that they regarded his remark
as a joke.</p>

<p>“Perhaps something will happen before you get
back,” Clay grinned.</p>

<p>“The boat may smash,” said Jule, cheerfully.
“It has been banged about quite a lot since we got
it. Or you may find some of the robbers. There’s
no knowing what streak of good luck you may get
into!”</p>

<p>“I’m not looking for any good luck of that
kind!” the visitor said, as he drew the rowboat
around and clambered into it. “I’ve had all the
cheerful incidents of that character I care to have.
When I get back to Chicago, I’m going to get a
room next to the Desplaines street police station and
go to bed at seven o’clock every night.”</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” asked Alex., abruptly as
he pushed off from the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“Gregg Holder,” was the reply. “I’m just
Gregg to all my friends, but I’m Bully Gregg on
South Halstead street. The others are Eddie Butler
and Hank Quinn.”</p>

<p>“That settles it!” grinned Alex. “I’m going
back.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Gregg, in surprise. “Don’t
you want a duck or a fish?”</p>

<p>“Sure I do,” was the reply, “but I’m afraid!
You’re the man that fought Murphy to a draw?
What? And Eddie Butler is the boy that bested
Murray!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got that right, kid,” was the reply.
“We’ve all been in the prize ring, but we’re no slum
toughs. If you think the bears and snakes and robbers
are better company than we are,” he added,
“we’ll get out of your boat!”</p>

<p>“You’re just the lads to give the pirates a good
drubbing!” Alex. laughed, “and so we’ll ask you
to remain with us and learn something of the rules
of polite society! Let me take one oar, unless you
want to keep on going round in a circle!”</p>

<p>“There’s something pulling on the boat,” Gregg
said. “I can’t keep it on a straight line. See if you
can find out what has tangled us.”</p>

<p>Alex. turned on his searchlight and cast its rays
on the water ahead. Then he dropped his light in
the bottom of the boat and stuck his hands out
straight. Gregg looked up as the light fell, then
dropped the oars and stuck his hands out straight!</p>

<p>“This is the adventure you wanted!” Gregg said,
as half a dozen negroes showed on a hummock only
a few feet away. “We’re held up by the river
thieves!”</p>

<p>“What do you fellows want?” Alex. demanded,
looking straight into the muzzle of a gun that
seemed to have a bore as large as the Hudson river
tunnel.</p>

<p>“We want that boat, so we can get on board the
motor contraption,” said a voice.</p>

<p>“That’s no negro!” whispered Alex. “It is a
white man blacked up!”</p>

<p>“Right you are!” replied Gregg.</p>

<p>“What are you boys talking about?” demanded
the holder of the threatening gun.</p>

<p>“We were telling each other how glad we were
to meet you!” Alex. snarled.</p>

<p>“You’re a nervy kid, anyhow,” said the other.
“Push the boat up here, so we can get in. We were
raised as pets, and don’t want to get wet.”</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but obey instructions.
They knew the desperate character of the men they
were facing. If they followed orders and waited
for an opportunity to turn the tables on their captors,
they might get out of the mess with whole
skins, but if they forced a fight there and then there
would be little hope for them. When there were
four of the pirates in the boat, crouching down
under the gunwales, who made the fifth, the spokesman
gave his orders.</p>

<p>“Now you boys row back. When we get close up
I’ll show myself and put the whole party under
cover. See? My men will also have their guns,
and if you disobey instructions in the slightest particular,
you’ll be shot in the back.”</p>

<p>“That’s where you like to shoot, I take it!”
growled Gregg. “If I had one of you out on the
bank I’d break him in two pieces and feed him to
the snakes.”</p>

<p>“Cuss if you want to!” commented the robber.
“We can settle all that after a time. Just now, get
over to that boat, and call out that you’ve found
another castaway in the swamp! We’ll be on board
before they can say a word.”</p>

<p>This looked like turning the <i>Rambler</i> over to
thieves, but there was no way in which the boys
could reverse conditions just then, so they rowed
toward the motor boat, calling out that they had
found a sick man in the jungle. The robber prodded
them with the muzzle of his gun when they did not
give the right inflection to their voices.</p>

<p>When the boat entered the circle of light the boys
on board the <i>Rambler</i> were all leaning over the gunwale,
looking for the boys and the rescued individual.
There were no weapons in sight, and Alex.
feared that all the revolvers were stowed away in
the cabin, and that the <i>Rambler</i> would be taken
without a shot being fired in her defense.</p>

<p>When the boat touched the hull of the <i>Rambler</i>
the robber sprang to his feet, presenting two long
guns as he did so.</p>

<p>“I’ll empty these guns into the crowd of you,” he
said, in a low, even voice, “if there is one move on
deck. We are coming aboard, and the better you
use us the better we shall use you. Just sit still,
boys,” he added, addressing his men, “until I get on
deck.”</p>

<p>He was lithe and strong, and was on the deck in
an instant, without opposition, his guns threatening
the amazed boys and their visitors. Captain Joe
gave forth a volley of ugly growls, and would have
attacked the man, but Clay ordered him back.</p>

<p>“Never mind the dog,” he said. “He won’t
bite!”</p>

<p>“If he does, he’ll get a chance to bite lead!” the
robber exclaimed. “Now, men,” he went on,
“climb up into the boat. Leave the rowers where
they are.”</p>

<p>Four husky negroes, all with traces of whisky
in their breath, began climbing over Alex. and
Gregg to reach the motor boat. As they were
steadying the rocking craft, they carried no weapons
in their hands.</p>

<p>Then something happened which was as much of
a surprise to the boys as it was to the men who were
trying to capture the <i>Rambler</i>!</p>

<p>A rope with a wide noose at one end came whirling
out of the sky and fell over the robber’s head,
resting for an instant in a neat coil on his shoulders!</p>

<p>He clutched his weapons closer and looked up.
Then the line tightened about his muscular neck
until his feet left the deck and his face grew red
with the blood of strangulation, then grew white.
The revolvers clattered to the floor, and the man’s
figure toppled and fell as the rope slacked.</p>

<p>When this strange thing happened, Alex. and
Gregg were bending their heads down to permit the
negroes to clamber over them. Still they saw the
rope fall, saw the man gasp as it closed about his
neck, and felt the negroes springing back in dismay.</p>

<p>Then they arose with their heavy oars in their
hands and struck slashing, crunching blows at the
heads below them! One negro lifted an arm to
shoot, but it fell with the bones of the shoulder
crushed to pulp. One by one they dropped out of
the boat, some with broken arms, some with broken
heads. After they had all disappeared, either under
the surface of the lagoon or into the darkness of the
swamp, a shrill voice came from the tree where
Mose had taken refuge from the snakes and the
alligators:</p>

<p>“Go on, white folks,” it said, “Ah goin’ hang
dis immitation coon up on dis tree!”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink21'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XXI—DODGING A POLICE BOAT</a></h2>

<p>“You little coon!” Clay gasped.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for Mose!” cried Alex.</p>

<p>“If you’ll come down here I’ll hug you!” shouted
Gregg.</p>

<p>“How did you ever think of it?” Case called out.</p>

<p>Mose, now the happiest little negro boy in the
United States, sat astride of his limb and grinned
until it seemed that the top of his head would drop
off backward!</p>

<p>In the meantime, the river pirate had remained
unnoticed on the deck, the rope so deftly dropped by
Mose still around his neck. Case finally bent over
him.</p>

<p>“Why!” he exclaimed, shrinking back. “The
man is dead!”</p>

<p>“Dead!” echoed Clay. “What killed him?”</p>

<p>Then they all bent over the still figure for a closer
examination. Just as Case had declared, the robber
was dead. His neck had been broken by the rope
when Mose had drawn him off his feet! Alex.
looked up at the boy.</p>

<p>“You must have a good pull in your arms!” he
cried. “How did you manage to swing him up?
You’re a wonder, Mose!”</p>

<p>Mose only grinned in reply, but Clay explained
the matter by saying that the boy had thrown the
rope over a limb higher up and used that as a pulley.</p>

<p>“Still,” he added, “it took a lot of muscle to jerk
that heavy man off his feet. I didn’t think the boy
had it in him.”</p>

<p>Then came the question as to what disposition
should be made of the body. There was no hard
ground near at hand so that a decent grave could
be prepared. There were marshy knolls, it is true,
but any excavation made there would instantly fill
with water.</p>

<p>“Well,” Gregg said, “the best we can do is to
bury him in the water. I don’t mean in the lagoon
or in the river, but in a grave which will fill with
water. There he will at least be out of the reach of
reptiles and wild animals when the water subsides.”</p>

<p>“But how are we ever going to get out there and
dig a grave?” asked Jule, who was not inclined to
waste much effort on the body of a man who, in life,
would have robbed, perhaps murdered, them!</p>

<p>“With your permission,” Gregg said, “we’ll take
the body out and bury it. I haven’t much use for
men of his type, but he’s dead, and that settles all
accounts!”</p>

<p>“We may be able to get a couple of birds for supper
while we are away,” suggested Eddie Butler.
“We have been so busy lately, that we haven’t eaten,
or provided anything to eat! I’m empty clear to my
toes!”</p>

<p>“And I’ll catch a fish off the boat!” Jule volunteered.
“I saw some big ones jumping up not long
ago! They’ve been driven out of their nests by the
flood.”</p>

<p>So Gregg and his friends went away in the rowboat
to bury the outlaw and get a couple of ducks
for supper, while Jule and Alex. angled over the
stern of the boat for a fish. The first rush of the
flood was past, but the water was still high. There
was a strong current rushing past the stern of the
<i>Rambler</i>, and this indicated that there must be a
channel open to the main river not far below.</p>

<p>The boys caught a great catfish and two
awkward-looking buffalo-fish and turned them loose in
the stream before they succeeded in getting anything
they wanted for supper. Then they caught a dozen
perch of good size and proceeded to clean them.</p>

<p>By the time the fish were ready for the pan Gregg
and his friends were back from their expedition
with half a dozen fat ducks, already dressed.</p>

<p>“We’ll have some for breakfast, and some for
dinner!” Eddie declared. “I feel now as if I’d
never get enough to fill me up again!”</p>

<p>Something long and twisting dropped on the
man’s shoulders and fell off to the deck.</p>

<p>“Holy smoke!” he shouted. “Look at the
snake!”</p>

<p>A shout from up the tree told of the trick Mose
had played on the man, and the rope was coiled
away. In a short time Mose came sliding down the
trunk.</p>

<p>“He smells supper!” explained Clay. “I’ve a
notion to set Captain Joe on him!”</p>

<p>“Dat dog don’t bite dis coon!” Mose replied.
“Ah’m in lub wid dat dog!”</p>

<p>Captain Joe and Teddy came forward and looked
the three visitors over approvingly.</p>

<p>“That bear would make a good meal!” Gregg
declared, with a wink at Case.</p>

<p>Mose’s eyes stuck out for a minute, and then he
tickled his own chin and gave out a sound like a
goat.</p>

<p>“B-a-a-a-a-a-a! B-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a!” he bleated.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with the coon?” asked
Gregg, with a look of surprise.</p>

<p>“He’s telling us to get wise to the alfalfa!” Jule
cut in. “Alex. don’t know how to translate so white
men can understand.”</p>

<p>“You’ll both wash dishes for a month!” roared
Clay, doubled over with laughter. “We make that
a penalty for talking slang,” he explained, turning
to Gregg.</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand yet,” the other went on.
“What is the matter with the boy? Has he turned
himself into a billy goat?”</p>

<p>“He’s suggesting that you mow the lawn!” Case
explained. “He doesn’t like the fire-escapes!”</p>

<p>Clay roared and pointed to the beards worn by the
three, and then they understood and joined in the
laugh until the swamp echoed back the sounds.</p>

<p>“You’ll all have to wash dishes, I take it!” Gregg
declared.</p>

<p>“That’s about the way it usually turns out, when
one starts talking slang,” Clay explained. “We’re
all so full of it that it just bubbles out.”</p>

<p>“It is fine that we have something to be jolly
over,” Gregg hastened to say, “for the prospects of
getting out of here are not alluring.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t be no fun if everything went right!”
Alex. insisted. “We have the most sport when
we’re lost, or stolen, or strayed away. Now, you
watch me cook these ducks.”</p>

<p>The boy got out a baking pan standing on three
short legs. The bottom was double so as to prevent
burning. Then he put two fat ducks inside, secured
the cover, and removed what seemed to Gregg to be
the whole top of the stove.</p>

<p>The short legs of the pan rested on the red-hot
coals in the firebox, while the cover was always
within reach. As soon as the ducks, which had
previously been hastily parboiled, began to simmer
and send forth appetizing odors, the boy watched
them every minute, turning and basting until they
were a beautiful golden brown.</p>

<p>In the meantime coffee had been made and the
fish fried on the electric coil.</p>

<p>“I presume you’ll want hot biscuits for supper,
too?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>The visitors were too busy with the game to do
more than shake their heads.</p>

<p>“We usually have three kinds of meat, fish, baked
potatoes, pancakes, light bread, pie, honey, and three
or four vegetables on the side,” Alex. explained,
with a wink at Mose, who sat in a corner next to the
deck with Joe and Teddy watching the meat disappearing
from a “drumstick” he was busily engaged
on.</p>

<p>“An’ possum pie!” the little negro boy added,
licking his chops.</p>

<p>“Sure! I forgot the possum pie!” Alex. declared.
“Excuse me!”</p>

<p>“Certainly!” laughed Gregg, “and we’ll excuse
you, too, for all future products of the imagination!
The twenty course dinners at the La Salle haven’t
got anything on this little banquet! For my part,
I don’t care whether we ever get out of here, now,
or not.”</p>

<p>“Some day,” Alex. observed, “I’ll show you how
to cook a steak à la brigand! After you eat one of
them you’ll go hungry for a week before you’ll
touch anything else!”</p>

<p>“You may lead me to one of them any time you
see fit!” Eddie laughed.</p>

<p>The river was still roaring and foaming about the
<i>Rambler</i>, caught in the narrow space between the
two cypress trees. Just where the boat lay the current
turned away to the east, that is the current of
the lagoon. The Mississippi was, of course, across
the inundated spit of land which lay on the west
shore of the river and on the east side of the bayou
or lagoon.</p>

<p>Just as the boys finished their somewhat delayed
supper the lights of a steamer showed up the stream.
It passed the mouth of the bayou and hugged the
opposite shore of the Mississippi for a time, then
headed for the west shore.</p>

<p>“That’s strange!” Case exclaimed. “She sees
our lights, but what is she coming over to this side
for?”</p>

<p>The mystery became more of a mystery still when,
reaching the west side, the steamer turned prow up
stream and started to breast the flood, still carrying
great masses of wreckage down stream. She made
her way up to the mouth of the bayou and stopped,
her propellers going just fast enough to keep from
dropping back.</p>

<p>“If I’m not mistaken,” Gregg suggested, “that
is a boat carrying officers on a hunt for the escaped
convicts. Can’t we get out of here before they
reach us?”</p>

<p>“Why should we run away from them?” asked
Clay, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Because they will mistake us for convicts,” replied
Gregg. “An officer in a position to abuse his
authority always does so. Many of the man-hunters
along the river are little better than the men they
hunt. Some of them are worse. This, of course,
does not apply to the sheriffs and deputies of the
counties touching the river, but to hired detectives
and gunmen who come here to make a living hunting
others.”</p>

<p>“You must be sore on the police,” Alex. exploded.
“I’ve got a lot of friends on the Chicago police
force. They’re good fellows, at that!”</p>

<p>“All right!” Gregg assented. “There are a lot
of good men there. But if you want to remain here
and permit those ruffians to overrun your boat, insult
you, and hold you prisoners until you can get to
some town where identification is possible, you can
do so. We can stand it if you can.”</p>

<p>“There may be some sense in what he says,” Clay
urged, “and if we could get out of the trap we are
in and make the propellers go, I’d be willing to go
on down the river and let the officers have the whole
country to themselves.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we follow this bayou current and get out
on the river below them?” asked Jule.</p>

<p>Clay said no; Gregg and his chums said yes.</p>

<p>“The water has been cutting a channel for a long
time,” Gregg explained. “It needed only a slight
push to send the remaining bank down. There are
few obstructions in the new channel, as I figure it
out, and I believe we would go through like a top
once we got started. And we’d better hurry, if we
are going to do anything, for, of course, they have
seen your lights. They wouldn’t have stopped here
if they hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“But the propellers!” urged Clay. “They’re
broken.”</p>

<p>In a moment one of the men had his clothes off to
the undersuit and was diving down at the stern of
the <i>Rambler</i>. He remained under the water so long
that the boys began to fear that he had met with
some accident, or been attacked by a snake or an
alligator. He came up smiling, however.</p>

<p>“Only clogged!” he cried. “You, Gregg and
Eddie, get axes and chop the east tree down! The
boat will then swing away from the other. You
must make the cut down in the water, then we’ll
have to lift the prow over the stump.”</p>

<p>The plan suggested proved successful, and the
<i>Rambler</i>, under power, and trailing the mattresses,
was soon feeling her way down the new channel.
Then excitement was observed on the steamer, and
she was headed about for the main stream again.
It looked like a race was on!</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink22'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XXII—THE SHERIFF KNOWS A LOT</a></h2>

<p>It was still raining when the <i>Rambler</i> headed
into the Mississippi, and there was no glimmer of
light in sight save that which came from the
steamer, still puffing at the mouth of the bayou, and
that which lighted the path of the motor boat. The
wind had gone down, and the slow, soft rain dominated
the night.</p>

<p>It was evident from the very start that the
steamer was no match for the <i>Rambler</i> when it
came to a question of speed. As well might a delivery
truck attempt to compete in swiftness with a
perfect touring car.</p>

<p>Besides the power of speed, the <i>Rambler</i> had
another quality which enabled her to rapidly increase
the distance between the two boats. The
river was still covered with wreckage, and the motor
boat was a good dodger! She responded quickly
to her helm, avoiding the driftwood ahead easily,
while the steamer was slower in picking her way.</p>

<p>“Your boat is a peach!” Gregg exclaimed, enthusiastically,
as the lights of the steamer dropped
out of sight behind a bend in the river. “Nothing
would please me better than a long trip in her.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Clay replied, “why not? We are going
to the Gulf, and are in no hurry to get there. We
are shy sleeping bunks, but if you boys can put up
with beds on the floor you are welcome to go along
with us. I reckon you’ll manage to supply your
share of the provisions!”</p>

<p>“The prospect is an attractive one,” Gregg replied,
“but I think we’d better stop at Vicksburg
and find employment of some kind. Later, we may
go on down the river in a houseboat of our own.
That depends on how lucky we are in getting good
jobs.”</p>

<p>“We shall be sorry to part with you,” Case put
in. “We have been together only a few hours, but
a great deal has happened in that time! Only for
your warning, the river thieves might have sneaked
aboard the <i>Rambler</i> and captured it. In that case,
you know very well what would have become of us.
We should have been murdered!”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt that you would have taken care
of yourselves,” Eddie declared.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing I want to ask you,” Clay went
on, “and that is about the outlaw you buried back
in the swamp. He was a white man, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes; a white man blacked up like a negro.”</p>

<p>“Did you look him over carefully enough to be
able to give me a description of him?”</p>

<p>“Well, we washed him up a little when we saw
that he was a Caucasian, and I got a fair impression
of his face, which wasn’t a prepossessing one, by any
means.”</p>

<p>“Can you give me something of a notion of it in
a few words?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Some old acquaintance of yours?” asked the
other, with a smile at Case.</p>

<p>“He might have been. The fact is, I thought I
recognized the voice of the spokesman.”</p>

<p>“There!” Alex. exclaimed. “I had that same
notion. Mose,” he added, turning to the negro boy,
“was that the man who threw you and the dog into
the water?”</p>

<p>“Ah sure done thought so!” was the reply.</p>

<p>“You think it was Sam, the Robber, the man who
accompanied Red?” asked Jule.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know but it might be!” answered Clay,
and Alex. at once insisted that it was the same man.
Mose was ready to swear to the fellow’s identity by
this time!</p>

<p>“Tell us how he looked after the black was
washed off,” requested Clay, after a short pause,
during which the three men compared notes—mental
notes—of their impressions of the man they had
left in the lonely grave in the swamp.</p>

<p>“We have decided on one word that expresses
our thought of the man,” Gregg finally replied.
“You know that all human beings in some manner
resemble some wild animal species. Some men are
lions, some are monkeys, some are dogs, some are
bears, some are foxes. Well, this man was a fox!”</p>

<p>“I thought so,” Clay exclaimed. “I thought the
fellow’s voice sounded like Sam’s.”</p>

<p>“There are many men with fox-faces,” Gregg
warned. “This man may not have been the individual
you refer to as Sam. If he is an enemy of
yours, keep looking for him.”</p>

<p>With this bit of good advice the matter was
dropped for the time. The steamer was no longer
in sight, but the <i>Rambler</i> was kept on her way to
the Gulf.</p>

<p>In the middle of the next forenoon they came to
Delta, which is at the bottom of the Vicksburg cutoff,
on the west bank of the river. Here, with many
handshakes and expressions of regret at parting,
the three men left the boat.</p>

<p>“If we have any luck at all,” Gregg said, as the
<i>Rambler</i> pushed out, “we’ll meet you somewhere
south of New Orleans. We’ve always wanted to
see that swamp country.”</p>

<p>The boys moved slowly down the river after that.</p>

<p>Again they were enjoying themselves, fishing,
hunting and exploring the country on either side of
the great stream.</p>

<p>There were lowlands, swamps, winding bayous
and forests in places. Again, there were plantations,
with noble houses showing from the river.
Whenever they halted at a plantation landing they
were received most hospitably.</p>

<p>The wreckage of the flood was running out of
the stream, and the water was dropping down to
normal. Occasionally they left the boat at night
and built rousing camp-fires on high banks. At
such times plantation hands often gathered about
them with banjo and mandolin and violin and made
the night musical.</p>

<p>They heard no mention of the Rock Island warehouse
robbery until they approached Baton Rouge.
The night before they sighted that beautiful city
they camped on a piece of high land on a small
island. No sooner was their fire blazing high than
a couple of rowboats skimmed across the river and
drew up near the little camp.</p>

<p>There were three men in one boat and two in the
other, and the whole five hastened to greet the boys.
They were evidently planters, for they were well
dressed and gave the impression of being gentlemen.</p>

<p>The man who seemed to be the leader looked
keenly around the camp, peered into the cabin of the
<i>Rambler</i>, and then approached Clay with outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>“I don’t need to ask who you boys are,” he
laughed. “I am a regular reader of the Chicago
newspapers. One of them, not long ago, printed
your pictures, including those of the dog and the
cub! If you’ll desert this camp and come over to
the house, I’ll be glad to put you up for the night.”</p>

<p>“I hardly think we would sleep well under a
roof,” Clay laughed, “but we’re all very thankful
for your kindness. Besides, we’ll have to remain
here and watch the boat. We’ve had some trouble
coming down, and are determined to be on our
guard.”</p>

<p>“You won’t find any river thieves around here,”
smiled the visitor. “I’m sheriff of this parish, and
I’ve taken considerable trouble to clear the country
of them. You say you’ve had trouble on the way
down? Then this must be the party that gave the
officers such a race up above Vicksburg?”</p>

<p>“There was a steamer chased us—for a little
while!” grinned Clay.</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand,” replied the sheriff. “The
newspapers were full of the incident the next day,
and you were held forth to the public as the boldest
of river brigands! Why did you run away from the
officers?”</p>

<p>“We only suspected that they were officers,” was
the answer.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t have taken long for you to have
found out,” smiled the officer.</p>

<p>“It might have taken us a long time to get away
from them,” Clay answered. “You know how
eager some officers are to make a capture. Well, we
didn’t want to be bothered with them, so we just took
to our heels.”</p>

<p>“The officers were looking for a boy believed to
be on your boat,” the sheriff remarked. “They had
information that he had been seen with you on two
occasions.”</p>

<p>“He must refer to Chet Vinton,” Case interrupted.</p>

<p>“I don’t know his name,” the sheriff went on,
“but he is the boy believed to have taken a hand in
the Rock Island robbery.”</p>

<p>“That is the lad,” Clay answered, with an amused
smile. “We have had him on board the <i>Rambler</i>
on two occasions, and each time he has mysteriously
disappeared.”</p>

<p>“Where did you see him last?”</p>

<p>“At Memphis.”</p>

<p>“That was after you rented a deposit box at a
bank?”</p>

<p>“You seem to know all about it,” grinned Clay.
“Yes, he left soon after I rented the deposit box
in the bank. By the way, do you know a giant of
a man, red-headed and kind-hearted, who is a gentleman
of leisure one moment and a river pirate the
next?”</p>

<p>Clay thought he saw suppressed excitement in the
face of the sheriff as he asked the question, and
waited expectantly for an answer. The officer hesitated
before saying a word, then he pushed the direct
question aside.</p>

<p>“There are a good many men along the river who
might answer to the description,” he said, “but I
can’t call any names to mind just now. What about
him?”</p>

<p>“Why, I met him on the river,” Clay answered,
resolved to be just as secretive as the officer, “and I
also met a man I took to be him at Memphis. I
have a notion that I would like to meet him again
some time. He’s all right, that man!”</p>

<p>“Tell me this,” said the sheriff, then, “what did
you boys discover in the old house on the bank of
the lagoon? I understand that at least two of your
party spent the day there. I’d like to know what
they saw and heard in the house.”</p>

<p>Clay regarded the sheriff suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Has there anything happened to us on this trip
that you don’t know about?” he asked, then.</p>

<p>“Why,” replied the other, “we’ve been hearing
about you all down the river. Don’t forget that we
have telegraph wires in this country, as well as up
north. Yes, we’ve heard a lot about you, and, to
tell the truth, I’ve been waiting rather anxiously for
you to make your appearance. What about the old
mansion, where the negro boy and the dog got your
friends out of a bad mess?”</p>

<p>“Say,” Alex., who had been listening, cut in,
“what do you know about that old mansion? What
kind of a gang is it that holds forth there?”</p>

<p>“You ought to know!” smiled the sheriff. “You
called on them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and they insisted on our making a longer
visit!” grinned Alex.</p>

<p>“Now, what is it about the boy?” the sheriff said,
changing the subject.</p>

<p>“You know all that I know about him,” replied
Clay. “He ran away from us following the visit
to the boat of the bank cashier and two friends.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard about that,” said the officer.
“Now, will you be good enough to tell me if you
have seen him since that night?”</p>

<p>“We have not, except that he returned to the
<i>Rambler</i> during the dark hours and restored something
he had taken away from her.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure it was the boy who came back
with the leather bag?” asked the sheriff, with a
most exasperating laugh. “Are you sure it was the
boy?”</p>

<p>“I am not,” Clay answered, wonderingly. “I
spoke too hastily. Come, Mr. Sheriff, tell me how
you know anything about that leather bag.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know much about it, that’s the trouble,”
was the reply. “I wish I knew more. Now, tell
me this: Have you an appointment with this boy
farther down the river? Do you expect to meet
him again during your trip?”</p>

<p>Clay replied that he hoped to, and the sheriff said
little more on the subject. He expected the sheriff
to ask for the key to the deposit box, but he did not.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink23'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XXIII—A NIGHT IN NEW ORLEANS</a></h2>

<p>“I believe,” Clay declared, after a long pause,
during which the voices of negroes along the levee
came softly through the night, “that you know
something about the three persons we are just now
interested in.”</p>

<p>“Name the three,” laughed the sheriff. “Who
are they?”</p>

<p>“First, the man we have always called Red, the
Robber.”</p>

<p>“You have referred to him before, my boy.”</p>

<p>“But you gave me no satisfaction,” urged Clay,
eagerly. “Do you know him?”</p>

<p>“I have heard of a man who sometimes answers
to the name of Red. What next?”</p>

<p>“The boy, Chester Vinton, accused of having had
a hand in the Rock Island robbery.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think I know anything of him?
If I knew where he was I’d be sure and keep him
long enough to find out what he knows about that
robbery!”</p>

<p>“And the third person is the cashier of the bank
where I left the packet. What did he come on board
the <i>Rambler</i> for? Who were the men with him?”</p>

<p>“The cashier said he was curious to see the
famous boat, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” exclaimed Clay. “That wasn’t the
reason he came on board! Honest, now, didn’t he
expect to find some of the plunder taken from the
warehouse on the boat?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what he expected to find, I’m sure.
I have never talked with him.”</p>

<p>“Now,” Clay went on, “you have referred to the
leather bag, the one thrown on the deck of the
<i>Rambler</i>. Who told you about the bag if the cashier
didn’t? I begin to think the cashier took the bag
and threw it back, or caused it to be thrown back,
when he discovered that it contained nothing of
value.”</p>

<p>“What did it contain when you first saw it?”
asked the sheriff, a twinkle in his eyes. “Let us
talk about that, for a time!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to show you,” Clay replied, half
angrily, “that I can be just as secretive as you can!
I don’t know anything about the leather bag!”</p>

<p>“Well,” the officer went on, with a puzzling expression
on his face, “if you come across this boy
Chet will you let me know about it?”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t!” replied Clay.</p>

<p>“That’s right! Speak right up, promptly! Now
I know just what to expect!”</p>

<p>“You might clear up the whole matter,” Clay
complained, “and yet you won’t open your mouth!
I’m not going to assist you—not if I get a chance,
which is doubtful.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the sheriff, moving toward the
boats, “I must be getting along! I may see you
later. If you come back this way don’t forget that
you are all to be my guests for a few days. I really
want to get better acquainted with you boys.”</p>

<p>“We’ll think it over,” laughed Clay. “We’re
thankful for the invitation, anyway.”</p>

<p>“And when you get down below New Orleans,”
the officer suggested, “look out for the real thing in
pirates! That boat of yours would make a fine
craft for a freebooter. And human life is not regarded
as very valuable down there.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be careful, thank you!” Clay answered,
and the sheriff and his men went off in their boats,
leaving the boys looking wonderingly at their retreating
forms.</p>

<p>“Now,” Alex. grumbled, “what did they come
here for, anyway? They simply let us know that
they were wise to our troubles and went away—without
finding out anything, or giving us any information
except that they were acquainted with
our movements.”</p>

<p>“They did ask for the boy Chet,” suggested Case.</p>

<p>“Don’t you suppose they know what it was I put
in the deposit box at the bank?” asked Clay. “Of
course they know! Now, why didn’t the sheriff demand
the key and claim the diamonds as stolen
property?”</p>

<p>“It is peaches to prunes that he has opened the
box long before this, or that some one has!” Alex.
put in. “He’s the original little pry-in!”</p>

<p>“I’m all out of guesses,” Jule declared, “and
so I’m going to bed.”</p>

<p>The boys saw nothing of the sheriff the next
morning. They were on their way at an early hour,
and, going at a swift clip, were within sight of New
Orleans by nightfall.</p>

<p>“Shall we spend the night in the city?” asked
Case, then.</p>

<p>“And where would we leave the <i>Rambler</i>?”
asked Jule. “If we left it on the river we wouldn’t
have any boat in the morning.”</p>

<p>Without deciding the point the boys tied up some
distance above the city and prepared supper. The
moon arose in a clear sky about eight o’clock and
the boys did not turn on the electric lights after eating.
They sat in the moonlight on the deck and
watched Captain Joe, Teddy and Mose tumbling
about.</p>

<p>“If it wasn’t so much trouble to dress,” Case said,
after a time, “I’d like to go to a theatre to-night,
and have a swell supper afterwards.”</p>

<p>“You don’t want much!” laughed Clay.</p>

<p>“Why not go, then?” asked Alex. “I’m not too
lazy to put on a decent suit.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean it?” demanded Case, rising from
his chair.</p>

<p>“If the others will stay and guard the boat I
mean it,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Go if you want to,” Clay answered the inquiring
look, “for Jule and Mose can help me keep off the
pirates! Only don’t remain away all night.”</p>

<p>“Ah done like to see dis town!” Mose suggested.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to wait until some other time,
Mose,” Clay replied. “You must stay on board and
help repel boarders now!”</p>

<p>The little negro grinned as if perfectly satisfied
with the arrangement, and went on with his boxing
match with Teddy. Case and Alex. dressed as
rapidly as possible and were taken ashore, in the
four-oared boat captured above Memphis, at the
foot of a street not far from a trolley line running
to the business center of the city. When Clay returned
with the rowboat, Mose was on one of the
willow mattresses which had been brought down
the river.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Clay called to him to come on
board, but there was no reply. Mose was nowhere
in sight. He had evidently started out to see the
city on his own hook!</p>

<p>“I reckon that is the last we’ll ever see of him,”
Jule commented, as they gave up the search for the
boy. “He’ll get to shooting craps in the city and
live there forever. Can’t do anything with a kid
like that.”</p>

<p>“It is hard work to knock any sense into the head
of a boy brought up on the St. Louis levee,” Clay
admitted, “but I hope he’ll return.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he followed Case and Alex., and will
return with them,” Jule suggested.</p>

<p>“That would be like him,” Clay admitted.</p>

<p>The boys were not sleepy and the moonlight was
fine, so they sat on the deck until midnight, waiting
for the others to return. They had not returned at
one o’clock, and the watchers were becoming anxious
when a call from the shore came to their ears.
In a moment the call was repeated, shriller than before,
and then there followed a splash in the river
and a shot.</p>

<p>The boys saw a figure swimming toward the <i>Rambler</i>
and got out their guns.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t look very formidable!” Clay observed,
as the figure came nearer. “It looks like Mose!
Now, what the mischief is the little coon up to, I’d
like to know?”</p>

<p>“It is Mose, all right,” Jule assented, “and there’s
some one on shore shooting at him. He may have
been up to some of his pranks on shore.”</p>

<p>Directly the shooting on the shore ceased, and
then Mose came on faster, not being obliged to
swim under water half the time. He crawled,
chilly and dripping, on deck and rolled his eyes at
Clay.</p>

<p>“Dey done got um!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What about it?” demanded Jule. “Who’s got
them?”</p>

<p>After much questioning it was learned that Mose
had left the <i>Rambler</i> in time to overtake Case and
Alex., that he had followed them into the city, and
had seen them talking with Chet Vinton, the mysterious
boy who seemed to turn up in the oddest
places and to disappear in the strangest manner.</p>

<p>The boys had talked with Chet for a long time,
the little negro said, and had not gone to the theatre
at all. Instead, they had gone into a disreputable
part of the city with the boy, and had there met
two men believed by the negro to be thieves.</p>

<p>At last, at a late hour, the boy declared, still with
much hesitation, Case and Alex. had attempted to
leave the little cottage where they were sitting and
had been forcibly detained. Chet, Mose said, had
been the first one to oppose their departure. Then
he, Mose, had dashed away to warn those on the
boat and had been followed by some of the men he
had been watching.</p>

<p>He described in glowing terms and very bad
English how he had jumped fences and chased
through moonlit backyards, and how he had been
shot at at every step of the way!</p>

<p>“I reckon you were shot at because some one
mistook you for a thief.”</p>

<p>Mose looked reproachfully at Jule, and rolled his
eyes wider than ever.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do now?” questioned
Clay. “I don’t know how much of this story to believe.”</p>

<p>“One of us might leave the boat and go back
with Mose,” the other suggested.</p>

<p>At mention of his going back to the place from
which he had fled, Mose rushed into the cabin,
lowered his bunk, and covered up, head and ears, in
the bedclothes! Captain Joe tried to worry him
out, but without success.</p>

<p>“I believe the dog can find them,” Clay remarked,
presently.</p>

<p>“I’m willing to go and try what he can do,” Jule
answered.</p>

<p>“If we could get that foolish negro to come
along!” Clay commented.</p>

<p>Jule went back to the bunk and shook Mose by
the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he cried. “We’re going to take Captain
Joe out with us and find the boys. You’ll
have to go along and show the way!”</p>

<p>“Fo’ de Law’d’s sake!” wailed the boy. “Let
dis coon die in hes bed!”</p>

<p>“Come on!” insisted Jule. “You’ve got to
come.”</p>

<p>After many arguments and many promises of reward
in the shape of yellow shoes and red shirts, the
boy consented to go ashore again. Clay warned
Jule to be watchful and cautious and saw him go
away with Mose and Captain Joe with a feeling that
a great deal depended on his good judgment.</p>

<p>Jule and Mose were obliged to wait some time for
a late car, and the walk to the quarter of the city
toward which their steps were turned was a long
one, so it was nearly three o’clock in the morning
when they came to a dilapidated old shanty near the
river front. Mose declared this was the place, and
Captain Joe seemed to think so also, for he said
quite positively, in his best dog-English, that there
were people he knew in that old ruin, which was
dark in every window and door.</p>

<p>Now and then, as the boys and the dog stood in
front of the house, loiterers of the night paused in
their aimless wanderings and regarded them speculatively,
possibly mistaking them for disreputables
like themselves. For a long time there was no sign
of life in the house, and then a soft footstep was
heard at the front door and the boys heard a knob
stealthily turned.</p>

<p>Listen as they might, they heard nothing more for
a long time, and then a figure dropped softly out
of an open window and moved off toward the river,
evidently failing to see the watchers crouched near
at hand.</p>

<p>“That’s Chet!” Jule muttered, starting away,
but Mose shook his head vigorously.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink24'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XXIV—SOMETHING DOING ALL THE TIME</a></h2>

<p>Jule was at a loss what course to pursue. The
boy who had left the house might be Chet, in which
case he felt that he ought to follow and induce him
to return to the <i>Rambler</i>, if that were possible.</p>

<p>The diamonds which had been placed in the deposit
vault belonged to Chet. At least the boy had
had them in his possession when he came aboard the
boat, and in the absence of any other claim upon
them they belonged to him. If they did not belong
to him, then their owner ought to be found. If they
did, he ought to have possession of them.</p>

<p>Just how a boy had become possessed of a fortune
in precious stones, Jule was not trying to figure out
at that time. What was in his mind was the thought
that the question of ownership ought to be settled
at once. This question, he believed, could best be
settled by the boy himself.</p>

<p>He waived, for the time being, all consideration
of the possible connection of the gems with the
Rock Island robbery, all consideration of the possible
connection of the boy with the man known to
him as Red, the Robber. Chet himself could best
decide the question of ownership, and Jule thought
he ought to be taken back to the boat, by force if
necessary.</p>

<p>Just as the boy was on the point of pursuing the
figure, now fast disappearing in the shadows along
the levee, Mose pulled at his arm and pointed to
Captain Joe. The dog, with short ears and tail rampant,
was crouching close to the closed door of the
house, uttering low growls as his paws moved
toward the threshold.</p>

<p>“Alex. in dar!” the little negro exclaimed.</p>

<p>Then there came a heavy, stumbling footstep
along the walk, and a burly man in the garb of a
riverman paused at the door, overlooking the boys
crouched at the angle of the house, but cursing the
dog drunkenly. Captain Joe behaved remarkably
well under the kicks delivered at him, and the newcomer
took a key from his pocket and opened the
door. Before he could enter the dog had disappeared
in the darkness of the interior.</p>

<p>“I reckon Alex. is in there, perhaps Case, too,”
Jule muttered.</p>

<p>“Yo’ sure cain’t fool dat purp!” Mose whispered.</p>

<p>The boys did not attempt to follow on into the
house by the open doorway, but passed on to the
window and entered there. All was still dark inside.
They could hear the man who had just entered
moving about, still striking at and cursing the dog.</p>

<p>Directly another key was turned, and then all was
confusion. Jule switched on his flashlight and the
circle it cut in the darkness revealed the man standing
in a doorway with a long-barreled revolver in
one shaking hand. The casings of the doorway appeared
to be of two-inch plank, and the door itself
was crossed by iron bands.</p>

<p>The man turned as the light flashed out and
fired, the bullet going wide of the mark. Then a
voice came from the interior of the room, a voice
which brought joy to the hearts of boys outside.
The voice of Alex.</p>

<p>“Get him, Joe!” the voice cried. “Get him
good!”</p>

<p>The man wheeled and shot at the springing dog,
but the bullet went off into the ragged ceiling instead
of into Captain Joe’s head, as intended.
Directly the dog and the man were in a struggle on
the floor, the only light Jule’s electric.</p>

<p>Alex. and Case came out of the room, leaping over
the fighters, and seized Jule and Mose in enthusiastic
embraces.</p>

<p>“Wait!” Jule commanded. “Get the man on
the floor first. The dog will take his life. Joe!” he
added, “let go!”</p>

<p>“Take him away!” shrieked the man. “He’s
chewed my arm off now!”</p>

<p>Jule picked up the fallen man’s revolver and held
it to his head while Alex. forced the dog away.
There was blood on Captain Joe’s jaws, and the man
on the floor was breathing heavily.</p>

<p>“Shut the door and put down the window!”
Alex. said, presently, “and put the light out!
There’s no more fight in this chap just now.”</p>

<p>“Here, I’ll fix him,” Case said. “I’ll chuck him
into this refrigerator and lock him up. See how
well he likes his own medicine.”</p>

<p>“But he’ll get right out!” advised Jule.</p>

<p>“Oh, will he!” Alex. answered. “Then he’ll do
more than we could. I’ll bet the walls of that hole
are a foot thick! And the air? I’m choked to
death.”</p>

<p>“We tried our best to get out and couldn’t,” Case
added.</p>

<p>“Suppose we see if he is badly hurt before we
leave him?” Jule put in.</p>

<p>An examination showed that the dog had seized
the fellow by the shoulder and bitten through the
flesh, making an ugly though not serious wound.</p>

<p>“That won’t hurt him!” Alex. declared. “His
chums will come and get him in the morning, anyway.
Chuck him in and lock the door and we’ll
climb out of this!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t the place watched?” asked Jule, peering
out cautiously.</p>

<p>“It would be if the outlaws weren’t drunk,” Alex.
replied. “There’s a copper over on the other side
of the street. Probably he heard the shots. We’ll
duck out of a back window and make for the
<i>Rambler</i>.”</p>

<p>The boys were watched furtively by the policemen
in that section of the city as they made their way
along the streets with the dog, but they were not
molested. When they came to the residence district
where there was little fear of their being followed,
Jule turned to Alex. with a grin.</p>

<p>“How did you like the play?” he asked?</p>

<p>“You saw about as much of it as we did!” was
the reply.</p>

<p>“How did you come to get into such a scrape?”
was the next question.</p>

<p>“The outlaws followed us from the boat,” was
the answer. “Oh, yes they did,” the boy insisted
as Jule grinned. “They were waiting for the <i>Rambler</i>
to come down stream! They thought we had
the diamonds and were going into the city to dispose
of them. They swore they’d keep us in that hole,
without food or drink, until we told them where the
stones were! I wish I’d never heard of the
diamonds!”</p>

<p>“Who was the other boy?” asked Jule.</p>

<p>“The other boy? Where? When? Oh, that
was Chet! We’ll settle with him!”</p>

<p>“The lad who jumped out of an open window
just before we got in and ducked away toward the
river. Was that Chet?”</p>

<p>“Blessed if I know!” Alex. answered. “It
might have been.”</p>

<p>“I believe that really was Chet!” Jule declared.
“It looked like him.”</p>

<p>“How did you get here?” asked Case. “You’re
a wonder! And Mose and Joe, too!”</p>

<p>As the boys walked along the story of Mose’s
runaway expedition was told, and Alex. immediately
grasped the little negro boy by the collar.</p>

<p>“You’re a little brick!” he exclaimed, “and I’m
going to see that you have a ’possum for dinner to-morrow—or
to-day, rather—if there is one to be
found in the city.”</p>

<p>“It is a wonder,” Case commented, “that the fellows
didn’t make an attack on the <i>Rambler</i>! After
they searched us, they talked for a long time in
whispers and then started away. I believe they did
go to the boat—and Clay there alone!”</p>

<p>“We ought to make better time,” Jule observed.
“Where do we get the trolley?”</p>

<p>“Unless we get an owl car,” Alex. replied, “we’ll
get none at all until the early run, and that will be
after five o’clock. Guess we’ve got to walk it.”</p>

<p>Eager, yet almost dreading, to learn the exact
state of affairs on the motor boat, the boys traveled
fast, breaking into a run now and then, much to the
wonder and amazement of the few negroes they encountered
making their way to the business section.</p>

<p>At last, just before daylight, they came in sight
of the boat. A short distance up the bank a bright
camp-fire was burning, and several figures could be
seen moving around it. All was quiet on board the
<i>Rambler</i>. No lights were in sight, either from the
cabin or the prow. The boys waited a short time,
wondering, and then Jule went to the levee and
looked for the rowboat. It was not there.</p>

<p>“They’ve got possession, I reckon,” he said,
when he came back.</p>

<p>“Then all we’ve got to do is to take it away from
them!” Alex. suggested.</p>

<p>“But how?” asked Jule. “We can’t go on
board without their seeing us.”</p>

<p>“First,” Alex. went on, “I’m going to make a
sneak up to that fire and find out what those men are
talking about. They may be all-right fellows, for
all we know.”</p>

<p>The others waited breathlessly for the boy’s return.
When he came back he said:</p>

<p>“They’ve been on board and ransacked the cabin.
They found no one there! Now, what do you think
has become of Clay?” he added.</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder they didn’t run off with the boat,”
Case said.</p>

<p>“Oh, they wouldn’t do that,” Alex. ventured.
“They want to get us. I half believe the men are
officers. What gets me is what they built that fire
for?”</p>

<p>“Probably thought we were fools enough to run
up to it,” hazarded Jule.</p>

<p>“But where is Clay?” demanded Case. “We’ve
got to find him. Do you know if they left any one
on board the boat?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear anything said about that,” was the
reply, “but it is a cinch that they did. And I believe
there’s more than one on board, too.”</p>

<p>“Hard luck to lose the boat after getting so far
on our journey!” Jule commented.</p>

<p>“We don’t lose the boat, if they are officers,”
Alex. hastened to say. “What they want is the
crew! We’ll fool ’em at that. I’m going to swim
over and see what’s doing on board. If everything
is all right, I’ll make a noise like an owl.”</p>

<p>“That’s a nice long swim,” Case objected. “I
don’t think you can make it.”</p>

<p>“Mose made it, didn’t you, coon?” Alex. replied.
“I’m the boy that poured the water into the Mississippi!
Nice adventure this?” he continued. “I’m
going to give the residents of the valley a chromo
each for the manner in which we have been entertained
by them! Here goes for the <i>Rambler</i>!”</p>

<p>“You act like you meant to walk back to Chicago,”
Case suggested, as Alex. started away, turning
away from the river in order to avoid the people
at the fire.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m only going to walk up a little way and
drift as I swim down.”</p>

<p>“Come up on the other side, then,” Case cautioned.
“Then you won’t be seen.”</p>

<p>When Alex. started away on his perilous trip
Mose disappeared, and Captain Joe was nowhere to
be seen the next minute. Case searched and grumbled,
but did not find them.</p>

<p>“They’ve gone with Alex.,” he suggested.
“They always do. Well, let them go, they can
swim better than I can! Wish I was along, also.”</p>

<p>“If they are officers, the men at the fire,” Jule
asked, “why don’t we go right up to them and find
out what’s doing? They won’t lock us up, will
they?”</p>

<p>“That is just about what they will do if they get
us,” was the slow reply. “We would get out of
jail in time, but who wants to lie in a cell when
there is so much fun to be had on the river? These
fellows have been wired to head us off, probably by
the sheriff we met up there. It may be that the
diamonds Clay put in the deposit box have been identified
as the ones stolen from Rock Island. I wish
Chet would show up right now!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if they want to coop us up,” Jule
agreed, “we’d better cut our luck until they find
out who stole the diamonds—or, at any rate, find
out that we didn’t.”</p>

<p>The boy ceased speaking suddenly, for the motor
boat was getting under way, heading down toward
the business wharves!</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink25'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XXV—COMMONPLACE, AFTER ALL</a></h2>

<p>“Can that be Alex. moving the <i>Rambler</i>?” asked
Case, as the motors sputtered out their insistent
clamor. “I don’t believe he has had time to get on
board yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, Captain Joe has, anyway!” Jule declared,
as a sharp bark came from the craft, which
now seemed to be turning around. “That’s the
Captain’s voice, all right.”</p>

<p>Standing high on the levee, with the lights of the
city growing below them, the lads watched the <i>Rambler</i>
for a moment and then started on a run up the
stream toward a small landing that was not far
from the camp-fire.</p>

<p>“If Alex. wasn’t on board,” Case reasoned,
“Captain Joe wouldn’t be there. If Alex. is running
the boat up to that landing, it is safe for us to
go there.”</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> did tie up at the landing, and then
the boys saw that the rowboat they had missed was
tied to her stern. The willow mattresses were also
still hanging on to the cords to which they had been
tied. The men at the fire started up toward the landing
as the boys reached it, but, much to the
surprise of the lads, they did not attempt to go on
board. In a moment Clay, Alex. and Mose showed
their faces on deck.</p>

<p>“Come aboard!” shouted Alex. “I’ve arranged
a surprise party for you here.”</p>

<p>“What is Chet doing on there?” demanded Case.
“I thought we left him with his new friends, the
thieves, in that old house in the city.”</p>

<p>“This is no time for story-telling!” said another
voice on board, and the man who had been known as
Red, the Robber, came out of the cabin and sat
down, calmly, on the gunwale. The boys on shore
were, by this time, prepared for almost anything.
When they reached the deck, Red waved a farewell
to the men on the levee and the boat whirled down
toward the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>“You see,” Alex. grinned, “we don’t know
where we are going, but we are on our way.”</p>

<p>“I know!” Clay insisted, “we are going to complete
our trip to the Gulf of Mexico. We’ve had all
the mystery we need on this voyage, and the next
one that starts anything in that line will be banished
to one of the mattresses!”</p>

<p>“All right,” Alex. retorted. “We don’t care
about knowing what this all means! I reckon it is
too commonplace to refer to again.”</p>

<p>He grinned at Red and Chet as he spoke, and they
both laughed back at him.</p>

<p>“We have with us to-night,” Alex. went on, in a
very good imitation of the after-dinner orator,
“Red, the Robber! His specialty is taking boats
away from boys and sneaking off down the river
with them—until some one gets the drop on him!</p>

<p>“We also have with us,” he continued, “Chester
Vinton, the waif who was rescued from a barren
island in the Mississippi with a hundred thousand
dollars’ worth of diamonds in his possession! He
will soon do his stunt of telling how he found them
in a piece of pie at a Rock Island restaurant.</p>

<p>“This wonderful Chet is also the last word in
friendship. When he sees boys who have befriended
him, it is his habit to turn them over to thieves, who
lock them up—not in anger, but to protect them
from other naughty boys!”</p>

<p>Instead of showing anger at this blunt talk, Red
and Chet sat down on the gunwale and laughed
until the river echoed back their voices. Clay also
seemed much amused.</p>

<p>“What’s the answer?” demanded Case, turning
to Chet.</p>

<p>“Now you boys just wait a short time,” Red observed,
“and you’ll know all about it. I would tell
you right now, only I see how hungry you all are.
And, seeing that I have a monster beefsteak in the
cabin, with ducks ready to roast, and eggs ready to
fry, why, it seems like we ought to eat before we
mix with any long yarns!”</p>

<p>So Case and Alex. took to the cabin, and the odors
of steak and coffee and roasting duck soon filled the
boat. While the good things were cooking the <i>Rambler</i>
dropped down to a wharf where a tank wagon
of gasoline awaited them, and there, also, loads of
provisions of all kinds were put on board.</p>

<p>And the strangest part of it all was that there was
nothing to pay! Red appeared to have temporary
charge of the boat, and the bills seemed to have all
been paid in advance. They were headed down
stream when breakfast was eaten.</p>

<p>“We ought to reach the Gulf in three or four
weeks, if we hurry!” Red observed, as he carved
the ducks. “That is, if we hurry in the right way!”</p>

<p>“I thought it would take until spring,” Chet broke
in. “I hoped so!”</p>

<p>Alex. regarded the two with a whimsical smile on
his freckled face.</p>

<p>“How long will it be before you’ll both disappear?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Never again!” laughed Chet. “Say, boys, I
did make a quick get-away a couple of times?
What? I hated to go, but I just had to.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and you prevented Case and I making one
at the house in the city,” Alex. said.</p>

<p>“It is all as simple as twice two,” Red observed,
sitting back from the table. “The robbery at Rock
Island was planned and carried out by Sam, the
outlaw who assisted me in the capture of the <i>Rambler</i>.
I knew that at the time I was with him—at
the time I let him go—or when you boys did,
rather.”</p>

<p>“But why didn’t you pinch him?” demanded
Alex. “There’s a reward.”</p>

<p>“Because I hadn’t then discovered the goods
which had been taken. He was going to take me to
them, I being a possible purchaser!”</p>

<p>“Well, of all the nerve!” Jule cut in. “Just
think of that, now!”</p>

<p>“Were they in that old house on the bayou?”
asked Alex.</p>

<p>“Some of them were. As soon as I got off your
boat I wired back to have the place surrounded and
searched. They found all the silks and furs there!
You boys did a good job for me when you permitted
yourselves to be trapped.”</p>

<p>“It was Captain Joe and Mose who did the good
job when they got us out!” Jule said.</p>

<p>“Did you find Sam again?” asked Case, in a
moment. “He was a corker!”</p>

<p>“You boys found him in the swamp,” Red replied
soberly, “and Mose executed the sentence of
the law upon him—hanged him by the neck!”</p>

<p>“So you are a detective?” asked Case. “Why
didn’t you say so?”</p>

<p>“I am not,” was the reply. “I am the owner of
the warehouse that was robbed, and I set out to get
the goods back, that is all.”</p>

<p>“But you asked us to take Chet on down the
river when he had the diamonds in his clothes!”
Alex. exclaimed. “What about that? It was a
funny stunt.”</p>

<p>“Of course I didn’t know that he had the diamonds,”
added Red, now to be known as Mr. George
Redmond. “He told me about his having had
them when I told him that Sam was dead, that was
last night, in New Orleans. Then he told me that
he had taken the diamonds from Sam because he
wanted to restore them to me, but had promised
Sam that he would never reveal his, Sam’s, connection
with the crime. Of course Sam never knew
positively that the boy had stolen the diamonds,
but he suspected.”</p>

<p>“And sent this riverman, Gid Brent, on board at
Cairo to see if the boy was there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he did that. By that time I was satisfied
that the boy had been in on the robbery—that he
had been forced to enter the building by way of a
window and open the door for the thieves to enter.</p>

<p>“I knew that the boy would tell the whole story
to me if I could get him away from the robbers, and
not scare him half to death by putting him in jail.
So I followed him along down the river. As the
robbers were making their way down toward New
Orleans, too, I was doing a pretty good job following
him—and especially as the robbers were after
him, too. They believed, all but Sam, he had taken
the diamonds, you see.</p>

<p>“They got him last night and searched him, but
found nothing. Then they told him that if he would
get Alex. and Case into their hands they would let
him go. So Chet did that very thing, and now the
two boys are witnesses that the robbers admitted to
them that they were in on the robbery!</p>

<p>“When they let Chet go he made for the <i>Rambler</i>
on a run, and found me on the way. All the
people who were in the old house are under arrest.
And the diamonds are up at Memphis in the deposit
vault, and all is well.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” demanded Clay.</p>

<p>“Why, we opened the box, the cashier and I,”
was the reply. “I knew they were there before I
knew that Chet had ever had them. My one great
difficulty was to get hold of the boy after he ran off
at Memphis! Your boat was watched all the way
down, you know, of course.”</p>

<p>Then Clay told of his talk with the sheriff, and
they all laughed at the idea that they had not seen
through it all long before.</p>

<p>“If Chet had kept to boats I could have found
him,” Red went on, “but he rode on wreckage, and
that made it difficult. I might have saved you boys
and Chet some of this mystery talk if I had told
you about it when I had Alex. in the cabin of my
boat, after I knew where the diamonds were, but I
thought I would let it work out for itself, especially
as I was having the time of my life.”</p>

<p>“I suppose those three mechanics were detectives,
too?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“They were just what they represented themselves
to be,” was the reply, “and they got good positions
at Vicksburg. They are expecting to meet
you down the river, in a houseboat of their own. I
saw them soon after they left you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder the robbers wanted to get hold
of Chet,” laughed Alex. “They must have been
red-headed when they found that the diamonds had
been stolen from them!”</p>

<p>“Yes, they were,” replied Chet, “but they didn’t
suspect me, at first. The man Brent, who came on
board the <i>Rambler</i> at Cairo, would have killed me
had he found me there. I was afraid he would, so I
took to the river.”</p>

<p>“And you took to the river again the night you
threw the bag back on deck, too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I got pretty cold, too. I knew where the
bag was, in the cabin, all the time, and I thought
the diamonds were in it. Believing it would be safe,
I did not take it and run away, as I had threatened
to do, but when the cashier and another came on the
boat I did take it and skip. When I found that the
diamonds were not there I threw the bag back just
to let you know I was wise to the game,” he added.</p>

<p>“It is a commonplace story, after all, when you
come to get it all told,” said Mr. Redmond. “If it
has spoiled your river trip I’m sorry for it!”</p>

<p>“We wouldn’t have had any fun only for that!”
cried Alex.</p>

<p>“Well,” Clay cut in, “now we’ll go down the
river and have fun! We’ll spend two months or
more on the way to the Gulf, and then we’ll put the
motor boat on board a ship and sail her around to
some point where we can get into the St. Lawrence
river. The St. Lawrence comes next, you know.”</p>

<p>“Why not put her on a gondola car again and
take her as near to the headwaters of the St. Lawrence
as we can?” asked Case. “I’d rather float
down than sail up, any day.”</p>

<p>“We will decide that when we get done here,”
Clay answered.</p>

<p>Those were two golden months for the boys, and
Mr. Redmond seemed to enjoy the outing fully
as much as any of them. They fished and hunted
and loafed in the numerous passages of the delta of
the Mississippi, and built roaring fires on the knolls,
when they found them, and lived the care-free lives
boys enjoy so much.</p>

<p>And then they were off for Chicago, and from
there to the headwaters of the St. Lawrence. Their
adventures on this noble river will be found in the
next volume of this series; entitled:</p>

<p>“The Six River Motor Boys on the St. Lawrence;
or, the Lost Channel.”</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
